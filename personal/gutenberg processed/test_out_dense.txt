And is it possible you can be tyâ€™d up to a Wife?
Pleasant this--Well, _Frank_, I do--And what then?
I say, let me no more see thee approach this Lady.
--But pray, how long, Sir, have you lovâ€™d me so?
Come, give me your Vows, or we must part for ever.
Why, Sir--what think you of debauching his Sister?
And you, _Frank_, will you marry my Niece _Diana_?
Well, and what do you intend to do, if it be, Sir?
_Enter_ Bellmour, _Sir_ Timothy, Sham _and_ Sharp.
Come hither, _Frank_, is not this a fine Creature?
--Nay, now--nor Heaven, nor Hell, shall hinder me.
Sir, my Lord Plotwell is at the Door in his Coach.
Rise, and whateâ€™er you ask, Iâ€™ll freely grant.

Hah, â€˜tis the Sot himself;--my name is _Carlos_.
What means he, sure he has a Gad-bee in his Brain.
I know thou wilt be true, and Iâ€™ll not doubt it.
Hey, Rogues, Rascals, Boys, follow me just behind.
Ah, nothing but a great gilt Coach will become it.
Oh, nothing is so ventrous as Love, if it be true.
Why, â€˜tis the great _Turk_, a Queen of _Turkey_.
Iâ€™ll see no more,--here I have fixâ€™d my heart.
--Attend these Captives, at a respectful distance.

You need not tell us, we have been witness to all.
By Heavâ€™n, each Moment makes me more your Slave.
Answer me first, what makes you here this Morning?
Away with it, to the Brideâ€™s _Haunce in Kelder_.
Pray, Sir, what store of Miracles have you at _St.
For sure thou canst not take a Shape to fright me.
--Take to thee Courage, and behold thy Slaughters.
--Hah--hum--whatâ€™s here--                 _Bel_.
Oh, Sir, youâ€™re welcome from _Northamptonshire_.
Hah--whoâ€™s that knocks--whoâ€™s there?--  _Bel_.
I wouâ€™d fain ask--a civil Question or two first.
Well, Sir, do you not know that I am married, Sir?
Hah--I hope â€˜tis no stolâ€™n Goods;    [_Aside_.
Believe me, that Dissembling was his Master-piece.
Why should he fear, did not my Father promise him?
It may be so--but she shall doâ€™t discretly then.

Away, be gone--Iâ€™ll never see you more--  _Gay_.

What meanest thou, is she not married?--  _Alcan_.
Oh, tell me not of kindness, whereâ€™s _Alcippus_?
â€˜Tis much, my Lord, youâ€™ll not be satisfyâ€™d.
Nay, why shouldst thou delay me thus with stories?
Thou hast amazâ€™d me, prithee speak more clearly.
_Re-enter_ Falatius, _with_ Alcander _melancholy_.
By Jove, there is no truth in them, thatâ€™s flat.
Nay, now yâ€™are too unjust, and I will leave you.
Thou knowâ€™st thy power, and now or never use it.
My Lord the Prince, what makes your Highness here?
--Where dost thou mean, bad Man, to hide thy head?
Why, Sir, do you think there can indeed be Ghosts?
--Sure I am fixt, what, shall the Devil fright me?
Well, Sir, your business, for mine requires haste.
What arguments will you produce to prove You love?
The Storm comes on, your Highness should avoid it.

CHESTERâ€™S FIRST EXPERIENCES IN NEW YORK     XII.
â€œI ainâ€™t rich,â€ said Silas Tripp, cautiously.
â€œYes, I had to part with my overcoat long since.
Silas Tripp has a small soul, hardly worth saving.
â€œI want everything to be legal,â€ resumed Bruce.
If you     have any others ready, send them along.
â€œYouâ€™ve got a tidy little place here, maâ€™am.
â€œI wonder where heâ€™s going,â€ thought Chester.
Donâ€™t you go for to run away.â€  Chester smiled.
â€œI say, thereâ€™s the tramp now,â€ he exclaimed.
â€œDoes Mr. James Long live here?â€ asked Chester.
He says that he left it behind in the office here.
â€œI think Iâ€™ll go to Dalyâ€™s Theater to-night.
He was shown at once into the professorâ€™s study.
â€œMay I come in, uncle?â€ he asked, with a smile.
Would you like to see him?â€  Chester shrank back.
â€œDid you come to see me?â€ asked Ernest, softly.
But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.
â€œWho are you?â€ asked the astonished bookkeeper.
â€œYes,â€ he answered, â€œhe arrived last evening.
â€œI bring you an invitation to dinner,â€ he said.
â€œOnly a rich boy,â€ corrected Chester, laughing.
â€œAm I to arrest this man?â€ asked the policeman.
â€œThereâ€™s a great row at the office,â€ he said.
On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon.
Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant.
Will you go over with me to Mr. Taylorâ€™s office?
â€œGood-evening, Mr. Mullins,â€ he said, politely.
He had not been aware that his stepson could swim.
A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble.
â€œGood-eveninâ€™, widder,â€ said Silas, coughing.
Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.
Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.
In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.
She was not particularly religious by inclination.
It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.
She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.
But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.
Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.
Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.
Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.
Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?
So both alike were defeated in their expectations.
For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.
Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.
There was no spontaneous interchange between them.
We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.
It all seemed really too funny to herâ€”too funny.
Whatâ€™s that for?â€ asked Lottie Witham shrewdly.
But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.
But it was Arthur who came out into communication.
â€œYou wonâ€™t _say_ you are,â€ interposed Arthur.
He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.
There isnâ€™t more than a minuteâ€™s fixing to do.
â€œItâ€™ll wash out,â€ he said, frightened of her.
â€œI must go home.â€  â€œWhy, whatâ€™s your hurry!
Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.
And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.
Iâ€™m afraid he will have to do that part himself.
â€œMushroomsâ€”most beautiful things in the world.
The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.
The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.
For she did not find him at all physically moving.
Although you smile.â€  Alvina did more than smile.
I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.
And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.
Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.
â€œI donâ€™t think you can see at all,â€ she said.
There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.
All alike!â€ Madame subsided fretfully and weakly.
The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.
But Mr. May was a little too frisky as KishwÃ©gin.
And now they think theyâ€™ve done it all, you see.
A tidy man, _I_ say.â€  He did not look at Alvina.
You know theyâ€™re only men dressed up, for money.
Of course you wouldnâ€™t be a good business woman.
Mr. May enjoyed himself hugely playing KishwÃ©gin.
â€œLet us see.â€  Max now moved his arm with pain.
Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.
Ciccio!â€ he yelled, dropping off his own bicycle.
Wants thee to come back.â€  Ciccio shook his head.
Come with me, because I havenâ€™t all my strength.
â€œTe voilÃ  donc!â€ she said, without expression.
â€œSure,â€ he said slowly, with subtle intonation.
And I donâ€™t want to rob Natcha-Kee-Tawara, do I?
She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.
He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.
She looked back at him, as from across a distance.
And I warrant theyâ€™ll want to be at the funeral.
But all the time she was uttering her condolences.
Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.
He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.
Ay, if she had her rights sheâ€™d be a rich woman.
Ay, when she thinks sheâ€™s hooked on to somebody.
She tried to think of Madameâ€™s slow enunciation.
â€œAll right,â€ he said, shaking her hand loosely.
â€œAll right,â€ he said, ducking and turning away.
Chiantiâ€”hein?â€  They all bowed above the table.
It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.
â€œI shall go and look at the town,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou will come with me to Woodhouse?â€ she said.
Come on bicycle with me.â€  Ciccio shook his head.
There were other people in the carriage with them.
She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.
Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.
What a blow you give me!â€  â€œWhy?â€ said Alvina.
â€œOh!â€ perked Mr. May, yellow with strange rage.
â€œNow.â€  For a second, she struggled frenziedly.
For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.
She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.
â€œItâ€™s not more than I expected,â€ said Alvina.
Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.
â€œLet us wait, and see.â€  She took it smilingly.
So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.
And if not?â€  The two women looked at each other.
Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.
The medical board were charming to herâ€”charming.
She could begin tomorrowâ€”but she had no uniform.
Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.
And the next time I ask you, youâ€™ll let me know.
But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.
Perfectly horrible!â€  â€œWell,â€ said the matron.
They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.
Then in the drive she picked up Effieâ€™s flowers.
I can understand a little Italianâ€”â€ She paused.
Ohâ€”!â€ She was wild and sweating with her pains.
But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.
He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.
Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.
Piace?â€  â€œDo you like it,â€ interpreted Ciccio.
Of course, I knew molto, from, music,â€ she added.
â€œHave you brought food?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Ciccio.
But thereâ€”a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.
And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.
This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.
Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.
I shall go to England.â€  He watched her narrowly.
â€œWhat is it?â€ she said, laying her hand on him.
â€œI canâ€™t come back.â€ She heard it so fatally.
She blew out the light, that she need not see him.

Our fountain-pen was an additional puzzle to them.
There were no bridges in this part of the country.
There was now only one plan that could be pursued.
For pillows we used the provision-bags and camera.
Over these latter our progress was extremely slow.
A funeral cortÃ¨ge was also a very frequent sight.
â€œWere you not rash in attempting such a journey?
What, not that I am to marry your Sister _Celinda_?
Why did not Heaven make all Men like lo _Bellmour_?
But grant I can speak, what isâ€™t youâ€™ll ask me?
Good gentle Nurse, have Mercy upon the poor Knight.
Yes, but we knew not that you were a Coward before.
Thou wert not wont to hear the Musick play in vain.
_Enter_ Friendlove _disguised, as one from a Camp_.
Take heed, Sir, what you say, for Iâ€™m in earnest.
--Say, Madam, can you love a Man that dies for you?
Oh, art awake--What a Devil ailâ€™st thou, _Frank_?
A Wench, or any thing--come, letâ€™s drink a round.
And I will know, why â€˜tis she is thus perjurâ€™d.
THE FALSE COUNT: or, A New Way to play an old Game.
How, are you not to marry his Daughter, _Isabella_?
and wouâ€™d the false, forsworn, receive your Vows?
And the first thing I met with was old _Francisco_.
As any Man in _Cadiz_, Sir, with good instructions.
Oh thou Monster of Ingratitude, have I caught thee?
But you must study to refine your Manners a little.
alas, my Lord, â€˜tis a silly Citizenâ€™s Daughter.
Dâ€™ye hear, hah?--this Lady has begâ€™d your life.
That you shall, Sir, Sol la me fa sol, &c.  _Fran_.
Come, come, we canâ€™t attend your amorous Parleys.
And how far is that from _Cadiz_?--but what care I?
Ay, Sir, to guard his Mistresses, â€˜tis an honour.
Take her, young Man, and with it both your Ransoms.
Am not I in the Possession of _Turks_ and Infidels?
Nay, dear sometimes have bought the Frippery stuff.
Sir _Cautious_, know my Nephew--â€™tis a young _St.
Quite out of breath--a Chair there for my Landlady.
I do, and therefore trust my little wants with you.
So may your change of Mistress do me, Sir--farewel.
Isâ€™t possible, Sir, you couâ€™d devise such News?
This is the most excellent revenge I ever heard of.
So, put it into my Cabinet,--safe, _Francis_, safe.
Fortune and Love invite you, if you dare follow me.
Sir _Feeble Fainwouâ€™d!_--rise,--are you both mad?
Hah--see, by Heaven _Leticia_, Oh, we are ruinâ€™d!
Wrong not my Brother so, who dies for you--  _Dia_.
Take Courage, Madam--you guess right--be confident.
I dare say neither of us were ever that way gifted.
I doubt youâ€™ll find it to my Grief--    [_Aside_.
Where shouâ€™d I be--in Bed; what, are you by dark?
What--to possess thee when the Bliss was offerâ€™d?
Hah, Ghost--another Sight would make me mad indeed.
Hah--whoâ€™s that, _Francis!_--my Nephew _Francis_?
THE FORCâ€™D MARRIAGE;  or, the Jealous Bridegroom.
Methinks thou now shouldâ€™st blush to bid me live.
Faith, Madam, try, youâ€™ll find it just like mine.
_Enter_ Falatius _with a patch or two on his Face_.
It lies as free for thee, and hereâ€™s my business.
â€˜Twas hereabouts--whoâ€™s this, _Pisaro_ wounded?
So will not his Majesty: I may be hangâ€™d forâ€™t.
And then my Honour by that flightâ€™s oâ€™erthrown.
--But come, â€˜tis late, what you resolve conclude.
For Heavenâ€™s sake, Sir, submit to be concealâ€™d.
To know where â€˜twas you learnâ€™d this Impudence?
But how, dear Creature, wert thou thus preservâ€™d?
| Yet nettled, Plague, what does the Scribler mean?

Came you, most reverend Bards, from the Moon World?
It was Ketch who bungled the execution of Monmouth.
On the whole, things did not look very encouraging.
He was shocked by Silas Trippâ€™s want of humanity.
She looked up in surprise at her sonâ€™s companion.
â€œI donâ€™t think I care much for life,â€ he said.
You found the whisky here.â€  Ramsay made no reply.
I wonâ€™t get too much elated, for it may not last.
â€œI will go up to Mr. Conradâ€™s room,â€ said Rob.
â€œNow,â€ he said, â€œI had better do the ordering.
â€œI know of Prof. Hazlitt, though I never met him.
â€œWhoâ€™s that boy?â€ he inquired, in a low voice.
You will find pencils and drawing paper before you.
The city I represent is a smart one and no mistake.
What will you do?â€  â€œI have some money saved up.
With twenty-five dollars a week he would feel rich.
This question will be answered in the next chapter.
It was not often that Silas Tripp went to New York.
He saw that the bait was likely to prove effective.
â€œOh, you mean the real estate office,â€ she said.
He was getting on fast with the professorâ€™s work.
â€œI will bear in mind what you say,â€ he answered.
When did Mr. Fairchild return?â€  â€œThis forenoon.
Make careful inquiries as to the value of property.
I donâ€™t think a man of your age would deceive me.
â€œOf course I brought him here,â€ growled Trimble.
Her father tended to a supercilious, sneering tone.
It was curiosity, deep, radical, burning curiosity.
â€œBut where do you want to go?â€ asked Miss Frost.
Miss Frostâ€™s right hand beat like a wounded bird.
â€œThen we must think about it,â€ she said, numbly.
But the new and recalcitrant Vina still shone hard.
â€œThank you,â€ said Alvina, and the girl departed.
What ought James Houghton to have done differently?
He would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever.
Wherever he was, his wife was a hundred miles away.
Getting on all right?â€  â€œFair,â€ said the woman.
When would he be able to get an advance from James?
I couldnâ€™t think of it.â€  â€œThen name a figure.
He wrote various letters and drew up certain notes.
The shop isnâ€™t worth while,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Itâ€™s a mercy Miss Frost and your mother are dead.
He was terribly secretive with respect to business.
I know we are.â€  Mr. May looked down in the mouth.
You couldnâ€™t get excited about it: not as a rule.
The trams, moreover, would begin to run in January.
â€œThese are my family of young men,â€ said Madame.
Que ferez-vous, mes pauvres, sans votre KishwÃ©gin.
Alvina hurried indoors, and the young man followed.
What a white-skinned, soft, plump child she seemed!
Alvina practised the music Madame carried with her.
â€œYes, youâ€™re wonderful,â€ said Alvina, choking.
Yet she felt convinced of his ultimate good-nature.
Helpless, inert she lay, in her orgasm of laughter.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras all sat with straight faces.
Then what future have you?â€ said Mr. May gloomily.
Ah, this Woodhouse, a curse is on it, I know it is.
Then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction.
You must never let them think you have caught them.
Still she smiled at him, and still he gave no sign.
But she could not make out what his watching meant.
He was a little bit repellent and brutal, inverted.
She loved them so much, she wanted to be with them.
He could not interrupt Alvina, nor the performance.
â€œFather,â€ she said, shaking his shoulder gently.
â€œCan you manage?â€ cried Alvina, showing a light.
Mr. May came in, and stayed for a dismal half-hour.
â€œI should like him to come,â€ said Alvina simply.
And if he will still have you, then you must think.
â€œYou return to the funeral?â€ said Madame coldly.
â€œBuy Miss Houghton outâ€”â€ said Madame shrewdly.
He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood.
Everything heâ€™s gotâ€™s mortgaged up to the hilt.
Alvina broke away from her cousin, and went to him.
â€œTell me what _you_ think,â€ she said repeatedly.
Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.
â€œAnd how is everything at Woodhouse?â€ she asked.
And after all, Woodhouse wasnâ€™t fifty miles away.
The young men had been out shopping for the supper.
Yes?â€ she added, with her subtle, malicious smile.
â€œPlease donâ€™t get up,â€ she said to the others.
â€œI donâ€™t want to stay here, anyhow,â€ she said.
Pas pour moi!â€  And they went laughing downstairs.
But Iâ€™m afraid we shall have a rather _dry_ game?
â€œI shall sell out of the Endeavour.â€  â€œReally!
â€œAnd have you told Miss Pinnegar?â€ said Mr. May.
Alvina looked at Ciccio, who stood above, watching.
And quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire.
You might come to the lawyerâ€™s with me, will you?
â€œYouâ€™ll be there at seven oâ€™clock?â€ he said.
â€œBut youâ€™re all right, yourself, Miss Pinnegar.
Itâ€™s all shown in my books,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
The cordiality, the _joie de vivre_ did not revive.
â€œTo look at the papers and magazines.â€  â€œHa-a!
Every one is most kind, and I feel at home already.
â€œFower per cent.,â€ mimicked the doctor brutally.
And I know that those things cause me half my work.
â€œOh yes, I intend to,â€ he said, with confidence.
But wondering about the Natchas would not help her.
She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.
His face was blind with anger, like a hot, red sun.
And both of us, since we are now one,â€ he replied.
Next month, at the latest.â€  â€œOh no,â€ she said.
â€œMy flesh isnâ€™t concerned, and my mind isnâ€™t.
â€œOh, the flesh is a _beastly_ thing!â€ she cried.
But she found Ciccio leaning against a gate-pillar.
Itâ€™s horribleâ€”â€  â€œWell, itâ€™s not my fault.
Come with me, Allaye.â€  She could not look at him.
She was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself.
But her chest was raw, she felt weak and miserable.
Ciccio too was feasted, in the dark hole of a room.
The old crone said something unintelligible to her.
Donâ€™t wait for me!â€ he cried, his voice muffled.
At times other, honey scents wafted from the hills.

an excellent physician.â€™    THE FORCâ€™D MARRIAGE.
â€œIâ€™ll go out and take a walk, mother,â€ he said.
In twenty minutes he handed the paper to Mr. Conrad.
â€œGood-night, and good luck to you!â€ said Chester.
â€œWhere did you find him, Mr. Perkins?â€ asked Rev.
The remaining space was left for the outside public.
They walked over to Broadway, chatting as they went.
He held the card in his hand, and was looking at it.
Did you enjoy the play, Felix?â€  â€œYes, thank you.
â€œThen it was not all put in one parcel?â€ he said.
â€œNow you see how I am making my living,â€ he said.
â€œNow,â€ said Edward, â€œI must try to get a place.
The picture drawn by Mr. Floyd was too much for her.
It donâ€™t take long for fifty dollars to melt away.
Every one wanted it, including the girls themselves.
But that peeled and quartered apple was her portion.
Then he flitted back at half-past twelve, to dinner.
She had to let James run the gamut of his creations.
The new entertainment was the Friday-nightâ€™s sale.
This was coming down in the world, with a vengeance.
In fact, all things considered, he was about square.
First the Board of Trade began to make difficulties.
Fordham being in some way connected with his mother.
There she had to go, right off, and help with cases.
There she had to attend lectures and demonstrations.
She had to confess that she liked the young doctors.
She bounced back into Woodhouse to make her fortune.
But Miss Frost sat by the dead in grief and despair.
Lottie Witham eyed the thin, nervous face of Alvina.
Her life was utterly barren now Miss Frost had gone.
And what she wanted was something serious and risky.
The shop was opened once a week, on Friday evenings.
â€œIt may well take your breath away,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou find it so, do you!â€ returned Miss Pinnegar.
He could not bear the sudden acute hurt to his shin.
â€œIt would be all the same if I did,â€ said Alvina.
â€œItâ€™s no more easy to understand,â€ said Alvina.
He had been in America, out West, doing shows there.
How wonderfully the satin of his waistcoat had worn!
And the two men came to no agreement _that_ morning.
And the address, please?â€  â€œI dunno thâ€™ street.
â€œI believe he has,â€ said Miss Pinnegar pensively.
I like a little yellow turnip,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
But itâ€™s so different with the mental friendships.
And _then_â€”she nearly set the stools on top of me.
â€œI canâ€™t believe they want nothing but pictures.
Odd, eccentric people they were, these entertainers.
â€œIâ€™ll run round for the doctorâ€”â€ said Alvina.
Best leave me.â€  â€œLet me help you,â€ said Alvina.
â€œWonâ€™t you all go downstairs now?â€ said Alvina.
The prisoner is tripped upâ€”falls, and cannot rise.
Her impulse was to turn and go away from the stable.
I _couldnâ€™t_.â€  Madame nodded slowly up and down.
â€œEnglishwomen,â€ said Madame, â€œare so practical.
Suddenly Louis started and held up a warning finger.
â€œI begin to wonder if I have mistaken my vocation.
They want it all through the eye, and finishedâ€”so!
But Ciccio it put into unholy, ungovernable tempers.
â€œThese Italians,â€ said Louis, turning to Mr. May.
Geoffrey smiled sheepishly, and his colour deepened.
The young men were moving about making preparations.
â€œIâ€™m awfully sorry you are going,â€ said Alvina.
He brought them before.â€  â€œBut I will carry them.
â€œDo you want?â€ he said, as if waiting for orders.
Even Ciccio she regarded as only one of the Natchas.
She forgot the question in others that occupied her.
â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ he said, in a brittle fashion.
â€œFatherâ€™s ill!â€ she announced to Miss Pinnegar.
Worn out!â€ Madame said, nodding slowly up and down.
You are his property, when you marry by Italian law.
Madame turned to look at the unhappy, elderly woman.
And then she had the satisfaction of sizing them up.
Look, thereâ€™s room for Alvinaâ€™s name underneath.
Quickly she put forward her hand to protect herself.
She entered, and he followed, flashing on the light.
And she turned her face to the wall, feeling beaten.
â€œCanâ€™t I do anything else for you?â€  â€œFor me?
Madame gave Alvina a fine awl and some waxed thread.
But run, run!â€  And Madame really stamped her foot.
â€œI have my key and can see quite well,â€ she said.
But obstinately he lounged into the street with her.
Within a hairâ€™s-breadth she had let him disappear.
â€œCan I come to Woodhouse?â€  â€œWhen?â€  â€œToday.
Helplessly she put her hand across the table to him.
He spread his hands, deprecating, not understanding.
â€œYesâ€”eh?â€ His eyes gleamed on her for a moment.
Geoffrey arrived, his broad face hot and perspiring.
Isnâ€™t that your opinion?â€  The other men laughed.
What, isnâ€™t it so?â€  â€œOf course,â€ said Alvina.
Ciccio stood with his hands on the table, listening.
Iâ€™ve made breakfast for years, now,â€ said Alvina.
Wellâ€”it might have been worse.â€  Again he waited.
They had regard for her possibilities as an heiress.
â€œIâ€™m going to keep the insurance money, any way.
Never had Ciccioâ€™s brow looked so ominously black.
And thenâ€”the unknown vengeance of the authorities.
And Alvina came in with the rest: she paid no board.
â€œWhy are you going to the library?â€ he asked her.
She could be quite happy by herself among the lakes.
Iâ€™d rather have him than your smarmy slormin sort.
Dr. Mitchell pointed to the green pile of cucumbers.
â€œMay I come in?â€ His voice sounded almost flirty.
â€œWhat do you think of this new war?â€ said Alvina.
Who was this elderly man, that she should marry him?
Certainly her shoulder hurt where he had gripped it.
They did not meet a great deal outside the hospital.
â€œDo play again!â€ Mrs. Tuke called into the night.
â€œDo ask him to come up for a minute,â€ Effie said.
Mrs. Tuke had a baby daughter, and was getting well.
She wondered if he had a right to be angry with her.
You donâ€™t want to marry a man you canâ€™t talk to.
â€œI havenâ€™t brought him,â€ he said, watching her.
Ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage.
She quivered, as if it was more than she could bear.
The sea heaved with a sucking noise inside the dock.
Then came the first cry one ever hears: â€œ_Porteur!
They expected Pancrazio to meet them at the station.
Words of American sounded among the Italian dialect.
Ciccio picked up the bread and put it under his arm.
â€œI told them to make a fire and prepare the house.
He seemed to do everything, old, stooping as he was.
They all tried it once, but they would not go again.
Approaching it were rows of low cabinsâ€”fairly new.
She went inside, and was almost sick with repulsion.
She sank lower on the flowers, and her head dropped.
She would do anything rather than be really crushed.
Poetry cannot lie because it never pretends to fact.
His reason for favoring the third view is important.
For him allegory involved distortion and perversion.
The poet presents truth under the guise of allegory.
The instrument of poetry was the rhetorical example.
If either are taken literally, they will seem false.
It truly makes a world nearer to our heart's desire.

We were alone, however, and that was rest in itself.
This tenting was all of a dark brown or black color.
Explanations were made, and the camels soon quieted.
For this, however, there is a very plausible excuse.
All these movements we photographed with our camera.
But, nothing daunted, they would pass round the hat.
â€œWill you run for any political office in America?
Again--tell me, what answer, Rascal, did she send me?
Come hither, Boy-- And said the Lady nothing to thee?
No, but that thou shouldâ€™st hide it all this while.
Doubtless her Reasons must be great for this Request.
You get no earnest of me, Sir, and so farewel to you.
I credit thee--yet--then, by Heavâ€™n, sheâ€™s false!

Why, thy Cuckold that shall be, if thou beâ€™st wise.

_Enter Sir_ Cautious, Bearjest, Noisey _and_ Bredwel.
Yes, Madam, I shall tell him--      _Enter _Bellmour.
But I shall improve â€˜em, Madam, Iâ€™ll warrant you.

There are innumerable contemporary references to him.
There is more than one reference to them in MoliÃ¨re.
I might do something with them.â€  â€œThank you, sir.
â€œThree hundred and fifty dollars!â€ she ejaculated.
â€œYou look strong and healthy,â€ observed Mrs. Rand.
It was some minutes after ten when he left the house.
Now the opportunity had come, but could he accept it?
He felt that it was important for him to do his best.
She was the nurse, who had constant charge of Ernest.
â€œNo, I want to stay with him,â€ indicating Chester.
You only wanted to get rid of the kid.â€  â€œExactly.
â€œI always did like Western people.â€  â€œThank you.
â€œYes, sir.â€  â€œI can tell you something about it.
â€œI think he is pretty well off,â€ answered Chester.
It would make it easier for him to discharge Chester.
â€œI guess Iâ€™ll go and see Chester Rand,â€ he said.
So he got up a false charge against me of dishonesty.
It may have fallen into the hands of your stepfather.
â€œIt may be because she doesnâ€™t know your address.
I am an old friend, and have a right to remember you.
â€œI have found a place for you,â€ he said, brightly.
About this period he received a letter from Wyncombe.
When do you want to start?â€  â€œAs soon as possible.
You may take the wrong cars.â€  Again Chester smiled.
Abner Trimble turned pale and uttered an imprecation.
Houghtonâ€™s Great Bargain Events were really events.
After some years of hanging on, he let go splendidly.
As James went further into life, he became a dreamer.
She had fully decided never to leave her two charges.
â€œSheâ€™s a lady if ever there was one,â€ they said.
The people did not like her, yet she influenced them.
And yet he felt Klondyke as the greatest blow of all.
But it was Throttle-Haâ€™penny that made him tremble.
The sardonic quality was, however, quite in abeyance.
For some days she went about happily, in pure relief.
I simply canâ€™t bear it, and thereâ€™s an end of it.
It was so characteristic, that Alvina almost laughed.
She believed that Alvina was just speaking at random.
She put it down on the drab-painted chest of drawers.
But her backbone became only the stronger and firmer.
But she never for one moment reflected on the advice.
Manchester House had settled down on her like a doom.
And so it was during these months nursing her mother.
The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled.
Become a nameless nobody, occupying obscure premises?
Miss Pinnegar watched him with a sort of sullen fury.
â€œOh well, so be it,â€ said her spirit vindictively.
â€œGood morning, Miss Houghton,â€ said Arthur Witham.
I wouldnâ€™t sleep in _that_ for a trifle, by myself!
â€œIt is bad,â€ he said furious because of the shock.
She got his handkerchief and wiped her fingers on it.
â€œItâ€™s got to be done, Sunday tomorrow,â€ he said.
Look here!â€ She showed the bloodstains on her dress.
There was something aggressive and vulgar about them.
There have been enough stories about ordinary people.
â€œI missed a chance there,â€ said James, fluttering.
â€œOne!â€ he said officially, pushing out the ticket.
Time came, and the colliers began to drum their feet.
â€œI donâ€™t believe they like the turns,â€ she said.
She was getting so tired of Mr. Mayâ€™s quiet prance.
She was supposed to be â€œcarrying onâ€ with Mr. May.
Queer cuts these!â€”but just a little bit beyond her.
Usually she spoke in French only, with her young men.
She spoke an appropriate good-night, to each of them.
He still shook dissent, but opened his mouth at last.
Then he straightened himself again, and turned aside.
He perked up his head in an odd, parrot-like fashion.
It was his instinct to say at once he would take her.
â€œYouâ€™ve seen nothingâ€”nothing,â€ he said to her.
You donâ€™t know anything by looking at these people.
That is very nice also.â€  â€œYes,â€ replied Mr. May.
â€œBut why is it?â€ said Mr. May, angry and petulant.
Max, thou dost not want to part, brother, well-loved?
And if thou canâ€™st find him, bring him again to us.
He knew Ciccio was dissatisfied, and wanted a change.
His skin was delicately tawny, and slightly lustrous.
â€œBut I donâ€™t like to take _these_,â€ said Alvina.
Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking.
Alvina felt a burning inside her, thinking of Ciccio.
He will go out to somewhere.â€  Alvina looked at him.
Or he will draw you down, downâ€”Yes, one or another.
But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them.
Offers of charity were innumerableâ€”for three weeks.
So much money is certain, perhaps there will be more.
Ciccio was on Alvinaâ€™s right hand: a delicate hint.
â€œDo have it since you like it.â€  â€œOh, I canâ€™t!
â€œReally, eh?â€ he said, holding out his large hand.
Alvina strolled away towards the half-open bookstall.
â€œFine pianoâ€”eh?â€ he said, looking into her face.
â€œI donâ€™t mind, really, if I can live,â€ she said.
You havenâ€™t a small travelling case, Miss Houghton?
Then she washed up, removing all traces of the feast.
Mrs. Rollings would not appear till later in the day.
You will be here a few days?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
May I ask where your company is performing this week?
Mercifully, for the mere moment, she was independent.
â€œYouâ€™ve heard?â€ said Miss Pinnegar dramatically.
â€œThatâ€™s â€™appen for them as doesnâ€™t like them.
This was another matter, apart from her Dr. Mitchell.
The matron softly closed the door again, withdrawing.
And then you need be surprised at nothing, _nothing_.
Apart from Dr. Mitchell she had a magic potentiality.
Yes do!â€ Mrs. Tukeâ€™s eyes were arched and excited.
Why shouldnâ€™t one human being go away from another?
â€œWeâ€™ll give him a glass of Tommyâ€™s famous port.
You should have faith in life.â€  â€œBut I hate life.
It was such a long time since she had thought of him.
You come with me.â€  â€œHa!â€ she sniffed scornfully.
She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow.
She caught Ciccioâ€™s arm, as the boat rolled gently.
But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky.
Adieu!â€ cried Gigi, clutching the other manâ€™s arm.
It had been dark a long time when they reached Turin.
Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them.
But it isnâ€™t the place for young people to live in.
â€œDonâ€™t you think itâ€™s fun?â€ she said, smiling.
The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment.
â€œI believe Iâ€™m going to have a child,â€ she said.
It all seemed alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.
Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian.
A shiver of horror and death went through the valley.
He hath bene knowne by his coate this thirtie Winter.
For they both invent,   fame, and devise many things.
But his ideas are based upon a very different theory.
Though less picturesque, it was incomparably grander.
The assembled rabble raised a lusty cheer at parting.
Come, follow me then, and you shall be both pleasâ€™d.
A dainty Boy--thereâ€™s Money for to buy thee Nickers.
â€˜Tis true, and I have now felt the Extremes of both.
Thou art mistaken, I hate all Woman-kind--  Sir _Tim_.
_Enter_ Flauntit, Driver, Doll _and_ Jenny _maskâ€™d_.
Sham, _and_ Sharp _sneak behind_; Trusty _interposes_.
Sir, I think we were best to marry her out of the way.
Sir, â€˜twas Parson _Tickletext_ that marryâ€™d â€˜em.
How fain sheâ€™d have me gone now; ah, subtle Serpent!
--Old Fellow,--prithee what Person of Quality is that?
Oh, dear Captain, let us tack about and go home again.
Slaves, no Sir, weâ€™re Slaves to none but the Ladies.
A good Cudgelling, anâ€™t please your Illustriousness.
Why, youâ€™re a _Mahometan_ Bitch, and you go to that.
Come hither, Slave,--why, was it that I gave you Life?
Why, what a Pox, is not this the Great _Turk_ himself?
This is the Course youâ€™d have me steer, I thank you.
What a leud Description hast thou made of his Chamber?
Oh, â€˜tis too late for business--let to morrow serve.
Bredwel _sees them,     and puts_ Gayman_ back again_.
And Sir _Feeble_, the Devilâ€™s inâ€™t if he know him.
Ay, but he could never do it fairly, thatâ€™s certain.
Youâ€™ve both offended Heaven, and must repent or die.
Nay, and she be thereabouts, thereâ€™s no discovering.
_Enter_ Alcippus _and_ Erminia, _as in a Bed-Chamber_.
Hold, dear _Cleontius_, hold, and Iâ€™ll do any thing.
The farce was repeated on 25 October of the same year.
I am of that opinion, Sir; Man was not made for Woman.
But have you never servâ€™d Countesses and Dutchesses?
Sheâ€™s taking aim, she cannot chuse but like me best.
Hold, hold, Iâ€™ll confess all, rather than indure it.
The Emperor, Sir, salutes you, and your fair Daughter.

â€œWhen one business suspends it affects all the rest.
â€œYou asked me where you could find a bed,â€ he said.
He has no money.â€  â€œNo, I ainâ€™t,â€ snarled Silas.
If your bequest amounts to anything I will not object.
â€œDid my nephew leave any money?â€ he asked, sharply.
â€œTwenty minutes.â€  â€œAnd you received ten dollars.
Chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard.
Mullinsâ€”been in this office?â€  â€œAbout five years.
A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.
â€œYou did not forget your appointment.â€  â€œNo, sir.
â€œThat is my poor, little cousin,â€ explained Arthur.
He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.
Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.
If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?
There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.
Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.
Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.
He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.
â€œAssuredly, my dear sir,â€ said Gripp, with suavity.
Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.
â€œIs that Mr. Fairchildâ€™s office?â€ inquired Silas.
â€œWas this package given you at the bank?â€ he asked.
I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.
â€œDonâ€™t you remember me, Mr. Wilson?â€ said Edward.
â€œWill your son be able to pay this?â€ asked Chester.
â€œI had a few dollars saved, and went to Minneapolis.
He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.
But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.
A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.
Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.
Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.
James hovered round and said the last word, of course.
He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.
He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.
The food was objectionableâ€”yet Alvina got fat on it.
It is but one side of the medalâ€”the crowned reverse.
Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.
Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.
She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.
Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.
And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.
â€œNonsense, child!â€ expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.
Will you explain why!â€ retorted James, turtling also.
â€œAnd father has no money, Iâ€™m sure,â€ said Alvina.
It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Withamâ€™s part.
He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.
The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.
â€œAre they for me?â€ she said, with false brightness.
I believe heâ€™s a despicable character,â€ said James.
Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.
â€œThe bone isnâ€™t broken,â€ she said professionally.
Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.
But all the time, what was there actually in her life?
She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.
Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.
Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.
He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.
As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.
Which is all I have to say,â€ announced Miss Pinnegar.
After all, your fatherâ€™s affairs donâ€™t concern me.
But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.
â€œGoodness!â€ she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.
â€œIâ€™ll go to bed,â€ said Madame, obediently rising.
â€œGood-night, my faithful Max, I trust myself to you.
Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.
What does Madame _do_?â€ she asked a little jealously.
But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.
He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.
Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.
â€œIf the bone isnâ€™t broken!â€ said Louis anxiously.
Please!â€  â€œWhat?â€ said Madame, eyeing her closely.
â€œYes,â€ he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.
She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.
She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.
â€œOh yes!â€ she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.
â€œBut you canâ€™t help it, away there from everybody.
It is all of it true,â€ whispered Madame vindictively.
â€œThis is polite behaviour!â€ she said sarcastically.
But Iâ€™ve been here many years,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.
But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.
I shall see.â€ Till one and all became angry with her.
â€œAt the station!â€ exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.
It was my great-grandmotherâ€™s.â€  â€œDo you mean it?
Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.
After all, she had been bred up differently from that.
â€œIâ€™ve had ham and eggs before.â€  â€œYou do, hein?
She clung to Ciccioâ€™s dark, despised foreign nature.
â€œWe must have supper.â€  It was past nine oâ€™clock.
Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.
Upon my word!â€  â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ said Alvina.
â€œGood-morning!â€ she said, and went on with her tea.
â€œBut you can have love without marriage,â€ she said.
She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.
There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.
She knew she would be much cheaper in Madameâ€™s eyes.
â€œYou tell Atterwell what to put on fatherâ€™s stone.
It must have been a detectiveâ€”some shoddy detective.
She insisted on Miss Pinnegarâ€™s having half of this.
Gradually Dr. Mitchellâ€™s manner changed towards her.
â€œI didnâ€™t intend to disturb you, nurse,â€ he said.
But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.
â€œI think to Windermereâ€”into the Lakes,â€ she said.
The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.
â€œI quite understand that,â€ he replied deliberately.
Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!
â€œDonâ€™t play a game with me,â€ he said dangerously.
But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.
â€œShall you come with me to Italy, Allaye?â€  â€œYes.
So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.
A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.
There were quarries near the railway, and men working.
The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.
â€œCome in, and warm yourself,â€ said the young woman.
And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.
It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.
She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.
But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.
She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.
â€œWould you?â€  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.
â€œHow nice they are!â€ said Alvina when she had left.
She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.

Mr. Tripp cut down my wages, and I left.â€  â€œDo tell.
â€œGood-evening, Mr. Tripp,â€ said Mrs. Rand, politely.
â€œFrom Chicago, maâ€™am.â€  â€œWere you at work there?
â€œGlad to see you, widder,â€ said Silas Tripp, grimly.
Everything was new to him, and, of course, interesting.
â€œDo you always eat here, Mr. Conrad?â€ asked Chester.
â€œNo; sometimes it is more convenient to go elsewhere.
Good morning, maâ€™am.â€  And Felix hurried downstairs.
Mr. Fairchild may suspect something if I move too soon.
â€œI am afraid Ernest annoys you,â€ said the professor.
Must you have me risk prison?â€  â€œDonâ€™t be alarmed!
I only want you to borrow two or three hundred dollars.
Finally his forefinger stopped at an entry on the book.
â€œI am ever so much obliged,â€ said Felix, effusively.
â€œWill my being a boy make any difference?â€ he asked.
I am Guy Radcliff.â€  â€œGlad to see you, Mr. Radcliff.

She carried it over her arm down to the Minersâ€™ Arms.
Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her.
In Vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering.
Over Alexanderâ€™s letter Miss Frost shed bitter tears.
It seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take.
There was a great bustle, preparing her nursing outfit.
For in her latter half she had to visit the slum cases.
It cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough.
And there was an abundance of Throttle-Haâ€™penny coal.
Wherein lies every moral that mankind can wish to draw.
Iridescent goldenâ€”could anything be more fascinating!
With Miss Frost its spirit passed away: it was no more.
â€œGood morning, Mr. Witham,â€ replied Alvina brightly.
She felt as if she were really venturing on new ground.
Arthur lingered in the doorway a while, then went away.
Look hereâ€”â€ And he began to pull up his trouser leg.
But Alvina had given the candle to Calladine, and fled.
For months, the thought of Albert was a torment to her.
â€œWe never can understand those things,â€ said Alvina.
I can see nothing wrong with him,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Yet it was always packed with colliers and work-lasses.
He had decided he must make a percentage in other ways.
Alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically.
It nearly killed James to take the prices they offered.
Madame and the four young men had arrived at about six.
Itâ€™s his business to go.â€  â€œOh!â€ returned Alvina.
â€œIâ€™m afraid your cold is rather bad,â€ said Alvina.
â€œManca il cuore solamente al Ciccio,â€ moaned Madame.
Afterwards he was to carry up the horse-hair arm-chair.
My poor _braves_, what will they do without KishwÃ©gin?
The two tall Swiss looked down on him, faintly smiling.
He glanced round at Alvina, then went on with his work.
â€œWe like herâ€”we love herâ€”as if she were a mother.
From the head I am business-woman, good business-woman.
â€œAlors!â€ said Madame, cutting through this futility.
â€œDost thou want to go with him?â€ she asked suddenly.
Tell him that.â€  Geoffrey turned again into the house.
He looked at her sideways, furtively, but persistently.
And then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner!
But I wonâ€™t stay a minute.â€  â€œOh, it is all right.
â€œYou get dressed, Ciccio.â€  Ciccio looked at Alvina.
The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.
She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.
He will not trouble you.â€  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.
But if you have decidedâ€”â€  Neither of them answered.
â€œMiss Houghton herself must decide.â€  â€œOh sureâ€”!
It wonâ€™t be much, then?â€  â€œReally, I donâ€™t know.
Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit.
â€œSo, we go together in the cab,â€ said Madame to him.
And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.
But she knew it was something improper, on her account.
Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.
And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.
Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.
Whyâ€”â€ he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate.
â€œHow do you do?â€ and she thrust out her hand to him.
I mean them.â€  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.
You need to be looked after.â€  â€œDo I, Miss Pinnegar!
Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.
Comment allez-vous, alors?â€  â€œBien!â€ said Geoffrey.
â€œBut I might be afraid of a husband-bear,â€ she said.
â€œYes, they both slept in the end room,â€ said Alvina.
I donâ€™t think so.â€  â€œBut even then,â€ said Alvina.
When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.
Madame did not consider Alvinaâ€™s view very seriously.
And cucumbers are poison to everybody.â€  â€œ_Cum-bers!
â€œMen are always intruders,â€ he smiled to the matron.
He could put a nasty intonation into that monosyllable.
â€œYou will take my ring.â€  â€œYes,â€ she said coldly.
There was a slight flavour of art and literature about.
There was a certain freemasonry in the matronâ€™s room.
The Tukes were not very richâ€”the young ones, that is.
I donâ€™t carry bags because my heart is rather groggy.
She would commit herself to him through every eternity.
They ran through Bromley and out into the open country.
For there behind, behind all the sunshine, was England.
She sat very still for a long time, almost an eternity.
The ship slowly put about, and backed into the harbour.
Some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness.
He had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest.
â€œWe will sit here, as I do, to eat,â€ said Pancrazio.
Pancrazio was very happy if Alvina would accompany him.
Alvina meanwhile would sew for the child, or spin wool.

A DYING GIFT       V. CHESTERâ€™S FIRST SUCCESS      VI.
During the night four or five inches of snow had fallen.
In a short time they had reached the ministerâ€™s house.
But, Mr. Tripp, Iâ€™ve come here on business.â€  â€œHey?
It was paid for out of the ministerâ€™s charitable fund.
â€œHow long were you in making the drawing?â€ she asked.
Heâ€™s talkinâ€™ of reducinâ€™ me to two dollars a week.
â€œI supposed youâ€™d stand up for him,â€ sneered Silas.
â€œWhere is my money, you villain?â€ he demanded, hotly.
There was one thing, however, that Chester did not know.
He discharged Abel Wood soon after you went to New York.
â€œHeâ€™s a scamp!â€ commented the man from Minneapolis.
â€œAre you going to the theater, Chester?â€ asked Felix.
He was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us.
I was in luck.â€  â€œDo you get six dollars?â€  â€œMore.
â€œIsnâ€™t he here now?â€ demanded Silas, with surprise.
â€œIt is a wonderful place, Chester,â€ said Mr. Perkins.
A pickpocket took it while I was looking in at a window.
When Mr. Fairchild returned Felix delivered the message.
â€œShanâ€™t I see you again, Mr. Wilson?â€ asked Edward.
It is two dollars more than I received at my last place.
She has     held out pretty firm, but she may yield yet.
I did not think to look.â€  â€œYour case is unfortunate.
Mullins, I havenâ€™t the least intention of harming you.
â€œThe next day my employer summoned me to his presence.
Perhaps all they lack is an occupation: in short, a job.
But the poor-spirited Woodhouse people were weak buyers.
The whole affair was ricketty, amateurish, and twopenny.
So she neither questioned nor accepted, but just let be.
At such times Miss Frostâ€™s heart went cold within her.
Act just for yourself, dearâ€”the rest doesnâ€™t matter.
If it had she would certainly never have entertained it.
But she had serious confidential talks with Dr. Fordham.
This was the end of another womanâ€™s life: such an end!
Her motherâ€™s little sitting-room was cold and disused.
It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master.
â€œBut we donâ€™t want father to go on with this scheme.
He seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element.
â€œNo, I donâ€™t know so much about that,â€ said Albert.
But it has its attractions.â€ Here he smiled meaningful.
Without a thought, she turned on her heel and fled away.
â€œAre you hurt?â€ called Alvina, looking up into space.
â€œWhich way?â€ she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.
In the Withamsâ€™ pew sat Lottie and Albertâ€”no Arthur.
â€œYou never spoke to Mr. Witham?â€ Miss Pinnegar asked.
Now he found himself more or less stranded in Woodhouse.
And swampedâ€”_swamped_ with her dirty old carrot water.
She scorned to count â€œWelcome All.â€ Mr. May said Yes.
But she marched down one of the pews, and took her seat.
But Miss Pinnegar was sadly hot and squeezed in her pew.
Sudden curtain, and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers.
Miss Poppy herself sets all store on her cup and saucer.
â€œHow much have we taken, father?â€ asked Alvina gaily.
â€œBut perhaps tomorrow.â€  â€œNo, today,â€ said Madame.
The bear drops Ciccio lifeless, and turns to KishwÃ©gin.
â€œI should love to go.â€  He looked down into her eyes.
Why are you at all?â€  â€œNonsensical?â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œAnd what about yellow eyes?â€ asked Alvina, laughing.
â€œMay I hear it too?â€  â€œOh,â€ said Madame, drawling.
â€œComment?â€ queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.
And how?â€”and where?â€”in this country?â€”tell me that.
Is he quite obstinate?â€  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.
Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.
â€œDo come!â€ she urged, never taking her eyes from him.
â€œWonâ€™t you come?â€ She smiled strangely and vividly.
Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.
True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.
â€œI should like awfullyâ€”â€ a flush grew on her cheek.
Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.
The doctor cameâ€”she went to the registrarâ€”and so on.
But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.
â€œOn ne fume pas dans le salon,â€ said Madame brutally.
Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.
â€œWhat about the theatre?â€”will it go on?â€ she asked.
I donâ€™t know, she doesnâ€™t seem to hook on, does she?
Sheâ€™d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.
â€œI couldnâ€™t keep away from you, Madame,â€ she cried.
You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.
â€œYet he promised.â€  Again Madame smiled sardonically.
â€œSee, my dear, that your money is safe,â€ said Madame.
â€œWhat a good brooch, eh?â€ Madame fingered the brooch.
There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.
â€œPacohuila!â€ cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.
Aâ€™ open â€™eart â€™s worth all your bum-righteousness.
â€œYou can have that if you like, Madame,â€ said Alvina.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.
But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.
â€œThe best!â€ He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.
And your father a month dead.â€  â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter.
He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.
Donâ€™t you all?â€  The two other men smiled and nodded.
Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.
Itâ€™s almost _White Slave Traffic_, on Madameâ€™s part.
She didnâ€™t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.
I wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation.
But their hearts hardened with black, indomitable anger.
But Alvina felt herself particularly excluded, left out.
Then she wired home to her doctor for another reference.
She went rapidly from case to case, as she was summoned.
â€œWhy I do ten times the work that any one of you does.
came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina.
But I think Iâ€™m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.
They went downstairs, and Alvina returned to her duties.
â€œThe pains have begun,â€ said Alvina, hurrying to her.
But the doctor had replied that Nurse would ring him up.
She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster.
â€œOf course!â€â€”another of Mrs. Tukeâ€™s exclamations.
England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging.
Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions.
â€œI think itâ€™s lovelyâ€”wonderful,â€ she said, dazed.
Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water.
His yellow, luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her.
Beautiful, in our musical sense of the word, it was not.
Fortunately he was turning round talking to another man.
In her room they opened into a grand bowl of lilac fire.

For the present, therefore, I feel obliged to retain him.
It will depend on the success I meet with in my business.
Now we can talk freely.â€  â€œThatâ€™s what I came about.
Why, I started off on a sudden without consulting anyone.
You will get no help from him.â€  â€œI begin to think so.

â€œThat canâ€™t be possible!â€  â€œIt is a fact, however.

They all seemed like blank sheets of paper in comparison.
She enjoyed the smell of a toasted bloater, rather burnt.
She was returning to Woodhouse virgin as she had left it.
With Miss Frost all was openness, explicit and downright.
But Alvina liked to be with Miss Pinnegar in the kitchen.
In the afternoon, directly after dinner, Alvina went out.
And of course, Alvina was considered a lady in Woodhouse.
â€œIs this one of your old walks?â€ she asked, malicious.
Putting her umbrella between him and her, she walked off.
â€œLet us go down,â€ said Mr. May, â€œand look at a site.
You must be prepared to spend something at the beginning.
â€œIn the theatrical line, Iâ€™m sure,â€ declared Alvina.
Alvina hastily retreated, but Miss Pinnegar stood it out.
Chot-let, penny a bar!â€ away she banged at another tune.
He came fairly frequently to Manchester House after this.
He cocked his blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened.
She was _dÃ©classÃ©e_: she had lost her class altogether.
And they had always a certain fund of callous philosophy.
The young men looked at her, and muttered to one another.
â€œChe natura povera, senza sentimentoâ€”niente di bello.
He was quite drunk with his first sleep, and saw nothing.
Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.
Youâ€™ve never been out of England?â€  â€œNo,â€ she said.
And then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business.
I am an old womanâ€”â€  â€œYounger than I,â€ said Alvina.
And now let me give you one little token of my gratitude.
Alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage.
â€œAre they both staying, or only one?â€ she said tartly.
â€œWhat _is_ his name, Madame?â€  â€œMarascaâ€”Francesco.
Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her.
Pity some nice young man doesnâ€™t turn up and marry her.
â€œCertainly,â€ said Louis, bowing also over his tea-cup.
â€œNow then,â€ said Madame briskly, â€œwe are all agreed.
And the young men stirred uneasily, and smiled furtively.
â€œHuronsâ€”Hirondelles, means _swallows_,â€ said Madame.
Madame locked up the jewels quickly, after one last look.
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m glad to leave it.â€ There was a pause.
La pauvre filleâ€”pauvre demoiselle!â€ lamented Geoffrey.
Miss Pinnegar wilted and felt strange under so many eyes.
Mr. May laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over.
Oh!â€  â€œNot if you think those thingsâ€”â€ said Alvina.
It was already ten oâ€™clock when she hurried downstairs.
Then heâ€™d believe in you.â€  But Ciccio shook his head.
â€œDoes it mean we owe seven hundred pounds?â€ she asked.
I canâ€™t believe it.â€  â€œSo he told me,â€ said Alvina.
â€œWhat are we to do?â€ said Max, pale on the cheekbones.
Curse them!â€ Louis was muttering, in his rolling accent.
They kept within the four-square enclosure of themselves.
â€œPffâ€”!â€ he went, with a whistling sound of contempt.
â€œWhatâ€™s that, mister?â€ replied the mystified hawker.
â€œThere!â€ she said, bobbing a little curtsey to Alvina.
Lancaster was busy with a sort of fÃªte, notwithstanding.
â€œI felt I ought to do something.â€  â€œWhy?â€ he asked.
Upon it was the mourning-ring Miss Frost had always worn.
â€œI may congratulate _you_, you mean,â€ said the matron.
And it cast a slight slur of vulgar familiarity over her.
This she gathered from her contact with the local gentry.
And to make me howl because Iâ€™ve got a child inside me.
The faint, stupid half-smile, half-sneer was on his lips.
Alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert Ciccio.
How sick she was of other people and their importunities!
Ciccioâ€™s a treat to be with, because heâ€™s so natural.
And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell.
It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her.
CHAPTER XIV THE JOURNEY ACROSS   The train began to move.
It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light.
And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.
But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad.
Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant.
And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced.
It was rather like the crying of half-articulate animals.
Alvina sat with Ciccio stripping them, in the corn-place.
This was where Ciccio belonged: his active, mindful self.
She came upon a bankside all wide with lavender crocuses.
The high-road was depressing, wherever there were houses.
Rose-red and gold-yellow of the flowers swam in her eyes.
Such drama Aeschylus asserts to be immoral in its effect.
They had looked to the poets for moral dogma and example.
Any writing, he says, should be expounded in four senses.

Faith, thatâ€™s right; why, then you must doâ€™t by signs.
â€˜Tis well--there we will dispute our Title to _Celinda_.
This Iâ€™ll improve, and so to your Advantage--  _Friend_.
Yes--why, I hope neither of you pretend to either, do you?
And well, _Frank_, how dost thou find thy self inclinâ€™d?
Ay, my Lord, a thousand more perhaps than are to be found.
Mine, Sir, I donâ€™t know the Gentleman; pray which is he?
Lord, that this shouâ€™d not enter into my Coxcomb before!
Why, truly, Sir--I did go to hire such a one--  Sir _Tim_.
_Enter_ Clara, Julia, Antonio, Jacinta _running to â€˜em_.
I thought him the fitter Match, Sir, and hope your Pardon.
Marry, Sir, and the wiser he; for they got nothing byâ€™t.
Why, what the Devilâ€™s your Business, and you go to that?
But what makes ye out at this Hour, and with these Jewels?
Stay, _Julia_--your Will shall be obeyâ€™d,    [_Sighing_.

And I wish for your Repose you neâ€™er had seen my Father.

â€œI have sympathy for all who are out of work,â€ he said.
In fact, nothing at all,â€ Chester was obliged to confess.
He would have been a bright boy if he had kept his health.
I donâ€™t draw all the time,â€ said Chester, with a smile.
We     may be able to throw considerable work in your way.
She was rather surprised when she saw who her visitor was.
â€œBravo, Arthur,â€ said Prof. Nugent, clapping his hands.
Have you got a place?â€ asked Mullins, turning to Chester.
â€œEighteen hundred dollars?â€ the latter repeated, aloud.
â€œIâ€™d like to know what all this means,â€ said Ralston.
â€œHow is that?â€ inquired Chester, in a tone of sympathy.
Once I heard your stepfather complaining bitterly of this.
I have some property at Tacoma.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t mean it!
â€œCan you furnish any evidence of this?â€ asked Mr. Dean.
I understood that my treacherous friend had given me away.
â€œWe have been separated long enough, Edward,â€ she said.
They all _wanted_ the middle-class girls to find husbands.
But no, they would rather give sixpence-halfpenny for W.H.
It was an ugly brick, painfully heavy and parched-looking.
But owing to her change of heart, she lingered indecisive.
With cold eyes she looked at him, and found him repugnant.
Alvina felt very strong and rich in the fact of her youth.
And they behaved as if she were exactly one of themselves.
Sometimes she wondered to herself, over her own virginity.
And at the same time, she had to constitute herself nurse.
Slaves who would cause the superimposed day-order to fall.
â€œYes, I shall remember,â€ said Alvina, beyond tears now.
â€œWell, weâ€™ll see,â€ said James, rising to superiority.
â€œThatâ€™s what it is,â€ said Miss Pinnegar vindictively.
â€œI canâ€™t imagine,â€ replied Miss Pinnegar, eyeing her.
She rebelled with all her backbone against the word _job_.
And now, in very low water, he found himself at Woodhouse.
And with those fatal words he wafted away to find Mr. May.
â€œOhâ€”Miss Pinnegar!â€ he said, and made to slip by her.
Houghton!â€ said Miss Pinnegar, in a sudden changed voice.
Come and Buy Without Price.â€  James was in his eye-holes.
But he exacted that they should buy one article at a time.
And yet she remained good friends with the odd little man.
Mr. Houghton was very much concerned over Madameâ€™s cold.
There was a slight look of self-commiseration on her face.
And so, what will they do without their old _gouvernante_?
The foreigners shrugged their shoulders, and paid no heed.
Can I make Miss Houghtonâ€™s father lose these two nights?
It was all very well for Alvina to bang the piano crossly.
â€œLeave me alone.â€ But he looked anything but all right.
â€œYou do not know him yet,â€ she said, turning to Alvina.
The meal, with the three women at table, passed painfully.
We must catch the train.â€  â€œOh butâ€”wonâ€™t you drive?
â€œAnd if there is something?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know either.
Wait one moment.â€ She went to the door and called Ciccio.
Why sure!â€  â€œItâ€™s dreadful, thoughâ€”!â€ said Alvina.
Max, as being the responsible party, looked business-like.
â€œAnd Miss Houghton shall have her professional name, eh?
Each _brave_ also kissed her hand, with a profound salute.
And she looked back at him, heavy-eyed and half subjected.
â€œThe gift of Pacohuila you know,â€ said Madame, smiling.
Onâ€™y weâ€™ve got to keep up appearances a bit, you know.
How _can_ youâ€”â€  Alvina was hustled off to her lodging.
With what close curiosity Madame examined the ruby brooch.
â€œI am tired, I shall go early to my room,â€ said Alvina.
They were a good-humoured company in the railway carriage.
Your poor father!â€  â€œIâ€™m sure the dead are all right.
â€œThis was my motherâ€™s little sitting-room,â€ she said.
And closing her book, she rose and went to the other room.
This house, and all it contains?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Alvina.
â€œVoyez, un cochon de lait,â€ said Gigi amply and calmly.
When Ciccio returned, Alvina was once more washing dishes.
She sang to herself as she went about her work downstairs.
Nothing is oursâ€”not even the plate youâ€™re eating from.
â€œThey want to say we are immoral foreigners,â€ she said.
â€œAnd never no different.â€  â€œNever,â€ said the doctor.
â€œMine _isna_, tha sees,â€ he said, â€œso papâ€™s no use.
â€œYouâ€™ll give me time to wonder about you, wonâ€™t you?
â€œIâ€™ve volunteered for active service,â€ she stammered.
Already she belonged to the revered caste of medicine-men.
Connected with him, she was a known and labelled quantity.
I canâ€™t bear it,â€ cried the strange voice of Mrs. Tuke.
He was heard talking to some one in the moonlight outside.
The moment Mrs. Tuke recovered her breath she began again.
But the slow, remote look in her eyes made this fall flat.
Her thoughts flew to Woodhouse, the grey centre of it all.
Alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like.
She was rather smoke-dried too, from perpetual wood-smoke.
There had been a little garden within the stone enclosure.
She felt the strange terror and loveliness of his passion.
A black hatred for the Mitchells of this world filled her.
She had to hide in her room till the cold wind blew again.
â€œIâ€™ll come back, and weâ€™ll go to America,â€ he said.

â€œThree dollars a week!â€  â€œItâ€™s what I call high pay.
â€œI should like to be an artist,â€ he said, after a pause.
And for the first time it dawned upon him he was an artist.
â€œHow much would you be willing to give?â€ put in Chester.
â€œWhy, mother,â€ said Rob, â€œis that you?â€  â€œYes, Rob.
You will know more about him in a week than I can tell you.
â€œI was a fool that I didnâ€™t destroy it,â€ he reflected.
Otherwise, how could James Long have recovered the receipt?
I havenâ€™t missed any.â€  â€œI wish he would help himself.
He looked like a man of leisure, with little upon his mind.
I never heard the name before.â€  Chester looked surprised.
â€œOh, you mean our office boy,â€ returned Mullins, coldly.
Where shall I direct?â€  â€œOh, just direct to Minneapolis.
â€œI wouldnâ€™t trust him any further than I could see him.
As for your son, you can only leave him to his own devices.
It was located in a large office building on Nassau Street.
Everything betokened prosperity, and Mr. Tripp was dazzled.
â€œMebbe Chester isnâ€™t adapted to the city,â€ Silas said.
â€œWhat is the matter, my boy?â€ asked Sharpleigh, blandly.
â€œI have spent over a year in the city, mother,â€ he said.
Abner Trimble looked disappointed, but did not dare object.
Now James Houghton had only one child: his daughter Alvina.
A manageress was advertised for, and work-girls were hired.
And doubtful if James was ever grateful for their presence.
His rather large, grey moustache was brushed off his mouth.
Alvina should have been preparing her trousseau, to follow.
It was August when she came home, in her nurseâ€™s uniform.
Sorrow and slow death, because a man had _not_ married her.
Our mothers pined because our fathers drank and were rakes.
They were everything to one another, Miss Frost and Alvina.

She would not care about marriage, if even she had a lover.
It hampers them, and interferes with their power of action.
She remembered Arthur had the same look, bending to prayer.
If help came, it would have to come from the extraordinary.
â€œGood-morning!â€ said Mr. May, stopping before the woman.
â€œAlvina!â€ Miss Pinnegar called discreetly down the shop.
â€œI might have put some in, if Iâ€™d known,â€ said Alvina.
â€œI suppose I donâ€™t have any say.â€  â€œOh but _surely_.
He darted out to drive James round in front of the curtain.
Didnâ€™t it?â€ And he laughed a high, excited little laugh.
Oh, I fell between the two stools beautifully, beautifully!
Could the devil himself have invented anything more trying?
And they hate it.â€  Mr. May watched her long and dismally.
She was surprised to hear Mr. Mayâ€™s opinion of the navvy.
He was dark, rather tall and loose, with yellow-tawny eyes.
Will you please to sit down.â€  They all took their chairs.
â€œI must go home for some things,â€ said Alvina to Ciccio.
â€œOh well, if you think so,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, nettled.
How she hated seething in the bath of her own perspiration.
Max solemnly, Louis gallant, the other two dumb and sleepy.
It was eight oâ€™clock before she asked her first question.
Alvina started and looked round at her with wide blue eyes.
â€œLet us go,â€ said Mr. May, bubbling with new importance.
Max slipped on a tattered hunting-shirt and cartridge belt.
You see, thatâ€™s it.â€  â€œBut how has Madame made it all?
â€œAnd I am very glad you have been such a good KishwÃ©gin.
Let us see.â€  So gradually Max was brought to stand still.
He will perhaps wait for me at his cousinâ€™s in Battersea.
And then one met the yellow pupils, sulphureous and remote.
â€œI am so sorry youâ€™re going away,â€ she said nervously.
She left everything now to Miss Pinnegar and Mrs. Rollings.
She scrutinized Alvina with her eyes of bright black glass.
â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Madame, cutting her meat quickly.
â€œGood-bye!â€ Madame fluttered a black-edged handkerchief.
And so should I without you,â€ said Miss Pinnegar doggedly.
There was something less than a hundred pounds in the bank.
â€œAssez de cette Ã©ternelle voix italienne,â€ said Madame.
Ciccio got up quickly and took his mandoline from its case.
â€œKishwÃ©gin must open your doors for you all,â€ she said.
Then I shall look as if Iâ€™d just been taking a _journey_.
And is _this_ quite final, too?â€  â€œQuite,â€ said Alvina.
Pacohuila, Walgatchka, Allayeâ€”â€  He smiled very broadly.
â€œYou have done it all, eh?â€ said Ciccio, glancing round.
He approached, laid his hand on her breast, and kissed her.
â€œYou didnâ€™t expect it would be quite so bad?â€ he said.
Now she had nothing, he would coolly withhold this respect.
â€œYou might almost have expected it,â€ said Mrs. Rollings.
And therefore, everything went charmingly at the Town Hall.
â€œToday is the day when you answer, isnâ€™t it?â€ he said.
She watched him, and wondered why on earth all this frenzy.
Which made her rather abashed, and much more uncomfortable.
At such a moment, what was the good of saying she didnâ€™t?
She did not know the other man; some theatrical individual.
â€œDo put me down!â€ murmured Alvina, stirring in his arms.
How can I depend on you at all?â€  Again he shook his head.
What was the good of trying to be Miss Houghton any longer?
Next to Alvina sat a trim Frenchwoman reading _Lâ€™Aiglon_.
He glanced at her from time to time, smiling constrainedly.
Then a tall bright schooner glimmered far down the channel.
Then the long night journey through France, slow and blind.
Many people alighted from the train, many surged to get in.
And the conversation once more became a spatter of Italian.
â€œMy sisterâ€™s husband lives here,â€ explained Pancrazio.
â€œThen we will get the donkey,â€ said Pancrazio stoically.
â€œWhy not?â€ she cried, in panic lest he prophesied truly.
Ciccio sat down on a chair and began to take off his boots.
It was impossible for her to become one with it altogether.
â€œYou wouldnâ€™t be happy here, so long,â€ he said, sadly.
â€˜Now you have had a taste of the cross,â€™ I said to him.
She loved the quality of his silence, so rich and physical.
They differ, he says, in their medium, objects, and manner.

He had evidently produced a good impression on Mrs. Trimble.

But what James lost downstairs he tried to recover upstairs.

Max, the only stubborn watcher, shook his head lugubriously.
But she was most careful never to give any room for scandal.
â€œI feel it is unlucky for me.â€  â€œDo you?â€ said Alvina.
Let us swear a closer fidelity, dear Madame, our KishwÃ©gin.
In the morning she was up betimes, sending a note to Alvina.
She walked up with Mr. May, and hardly noticed he was there.
Whoâ€™s the other?â€ Miss Pinnegar looked sharply at Alvina.
He sticks to nothingâ€”â€  â€œHow old is he?â€ asked Alvina.
I donâ€™t know Miss Houghtonâ€™s intentions,â€ said Mr. May.
â€œYou should form a company, and carry onâ€”â€ said Madame.
No, thatâ€™s her fatherâ€™s cousin who sheâ€™s walking with.
And so everybody began to say â€œIâ€™m getting tired of her.
A thousand pounds?â€  â€œOh, itâ€™s just possible, you know.
Mind it is not lost.â€  â€œItâ€™s all I have,â€ said Alvina.
Alvina unfastened her bag and counted the crisp white notes.
Only a real fear of offending Madame drove her down at last.
â€œGood-night all.â€  They rose and bowed their good-nights.
He covered it for one moment with his hand, then ignored it.
â€œYouâ€™re not asking him to stay the night,â€ she blurted.
â€œAnd write the name of your father and mother,â€ she said.
nâ€™est-ce pas?â€  â€œYâ€™a place pour trois,â€ said Ciccio.
â€œWhat would your _father_ say to this?â€ she said sternly.
I donâ€™t know how ever youâ€™ll be saved, after such a sin.
Then she went upstairs, to do the bedrooms and pack her bag.
There you are!â€ Madame smiled archly, and rather mockingly.
And therefore, the next day, everything went as if by magic.
You mustnâ€™t look, or youâ€™re done for.â€  Alvina laughed.
Youâ€™re that fond of them?â€  â€œI find they agree with me.
When do you think _I_ can sit at table and digest my dinner?
â€œWe might make a tour of the Lakes before long,â€ he said.
He smiled broadly, but with a tension of nervous excitement.
For one thing, mere curiosity made her want to see the ring.
Love me!â€  Alvina was absolutely dumbfounded by this scene.
â€œYou never know what men will do till youâ€™ve known them.
On nâ€™entre pasâ€”â€ called the well-known voice of Ciccio.
From a bush at the side she pulled two sweet-smelling roses.
I want you,â€ sang the uneasy, querulous voice of Mrs. Tuke.
Alvina remained with her hair-brush suspended, watching him.
â€œI shall go where I like.â€  But slowly he shook his head.
The official scrutinized her, and asked questions of Ciccio.
Alvina got a placeâ€”but Ciccio had to stay in the corridor.
The train came to sudden halts, and stood still in the snow.
â€œWhat are they doing?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Ciccio.
But Giovanni blew on, his eyes sparkling, looking to Alvina.
Then deliberately she got out of bed and went across to him.
You must never come so far alone.â€  â€œWhy not?â€ she said.
It is only for old men,â€ he said, talking of Pescocalascio.
Pancrazio would tell Alvina about his wife and her ailments.
â€œI havenâ€™t any hope,â€ he said, in a dull, dogged voice.
Tully, the only orator mentioned, shares a line with Virgil.
Yet it is the most characteristic Latin rhetoric we possess.
Eratosthenes took an extreme view in seeking pleasure alone.
Thus all arts proceed from it, and rhetoric is a part of it.
That poetry did have this improving effect he is quite sure.
This is almost exactly Aristotle's phrase in the _Rhetoric_.

They are necessary evilsâ€”_adet_ (custom) has made them so.
All sorts of queries and ejaculations would pass among them.
Even when told the difference, our ears could not detect it.
This they would do with remarkable fluency and intelligence.
Why, how now, Sir _Timothy_, what, up in Arms with the Women?
Yes, that he canâ€™t deny us the very Day after his Marriage.
thou shouldâ€™st begin to think of something more than Books.
Nay, â€˜tis time we departed then, and shifted for ourselves.
Have you sunk none indeed and indeed, my _Timmy?_  Sir _Tim_.
Readily, Sir--heâ€™s a brave Fellow, and must not be lost so.
Persons so near of Kin do seldom prosper in the Marriage-Bed.
Then I have kneelâ€™d--and cryâ€™d, and swore--and--  _Phil_.
pray, for what Sin of mine must your fair Eyes be punishâ€™d?
Art sure â€˜tis not the Governor?--Iâ€™ll go lock up my Wife.
Heâ€™s safe for one dear half hour, Iâ€™ll warrant you, come.
I know you to be a Slave, and the Great _Turkâ€™s_ Slave too.
No, Sir; safe in _Antonio Villa_, within a League of _Cadiz_.
â€˜Tis Example that prevails above Reason or DIVINE PRECEPTS.
Hold, remember youâ€™re proscribed, And die if you are taken.
Iâ€™ve done, and I will live, but he shall neâ€™er enjoy her.
Hah--Sir _Feeble_, and Sir _Cautious_ there--what shall I do?
You cannot satisfy your Dunning Taylor, To cry--I am in Love!
May all the Mischiefs of despairing Love Fall on me if it be.
_Enter_ Philander, Alcander, Galatea, Aminta, _and_ Falatius.
Why, I have no great skill; but they say it may be dangerous.

His mother looked at him in surprise as he entered the house.
â€œDo you knew Mr. Fairchild?â€ he at length asked, abruptly.
But you must buy me a package of cigarettes.â€  â€œVery well.
â€œHowever, heâ€™ll soon break over his virtuous resolutions.
â€œI come from Mr. Fairchildâ€™s office,â€ explained Chester.
â€œErnest has found a friend, Margaret,â€ said the professor.
â€œYou might set up a jewelerâ€™s store,â€ suggested Chester.
From motives of prudence I only risked five dollars at first.
Savagely I threw down the remaining five and won twenty-five.
I told him you were satisfied with your position in the city.
â€œAre you Chester Rand?â€ he asked, in a high-pitched voice.
Iâ€™ve seen the town of Tacoma, where youâ€™ve got five lots.
Have you heard from Fairchild yet?â€  â€œNo; it isnâ€™t time.
I am discharged.â€  â€œWhat!â€ exclaimed Arthur, in surprise.
He received at his lodgings the following letter:      â€œMR.
It is backed by sufficient capital to     insure its success.
I may be able to do better afterward.â€  Chester was dazzled.
â€œDid you hear anything of him?â€ Mrs. Rand naturally asked.
It wasnâ€™t true, but it was only an excuse to get rid of me.
â€œMeanwhile you are out of money, I suppose,â€ said Chester.
â€œLet me advise you to take some soup first,â€ said Chester.
â€œNow Iâ€™ll answer your questions,â€ said Nathaniel Wilson.
He says he has not had anyone to     suit him since you left.
â€œOf course, the son being dead, it wonâ€™t count.â€  â€œMr.
â€œEdward!â€ she exclaimed, and half rising, opened her arms.

James Houghtonâ€™s shop was regarded as a weekly comic issue.
But, becoming used to disillusionment, he almost welcomed it.
But a mining population scorned such dirt, as they called it.
The name Connection Meadow was forgotten within three months.
She seemed to nestle into the well-known surety of Woodhouse.
She went through her training experiences like another being.
For a moment she surged in massive, inhuman, female strength.
In short, he should have been somebody else, and not himself.
Remarkable how little trace her mother leftâ€”hardly a trace.
She imagined him a taller, more fascinating, educated Arthur.
â€œIâ€™ll stroll up with you, if you donâ€™t mind,â€ he said.
She heard her fatherâ€™s step at last tripping down the shop.
â€œWhat has _he_ got to do with you?â€ said James shrewishly.
â€œItâ€™s many a day since I was on this railroad,â€ he said.
It was a nasty cut bruise, swelling and looking very painful.
â€œIâ€™ve made up my mind about Albert Witham,â€ said Alvina.
Then he would take her to South Africa: a whole new _milieu_.
They found one barren patch where two caravans were standing.
The next morning he was ringing for his tea at six oâ€™clock.
Thatâ€™s Missisâ€™ sister.â€  â€œThe Three Bellsâ€”thank you.
â€œFather might almost have sold him the suit,â€ said Alvina.
But Miss Pinnegar, the engine of wrath, felt she would burst.
â€œBuying a cinema showâ€”and that man we saw is his manager.
â€œFor in Spooney-ooney Island Is there any one cares for me?
None the less, Mr. May was dependable in matters of business.
â€œOh, fatherâ€™s in his eye-holes,â€ said Alvina to Mr. May.
Weâ€™n come ter hear tâ€™ parson.â€  Theme for endless jokes.
Thereâ€™s six nights to a week.â€ James was properly snubbed.
In vain the boy most pertinently yelled â€œChot-letâ€ at her.
Iâ€™ll see if thereâ€™s a fire in the bedroom,â€ said Alvina.
Geoffrey obediently went out with a lantern to the coal-shed.
But in vain Louis lifted Ciccioâ€™s shoulders from the table.
â€œWake up,â€ said Alvina, laughing, pressing his hand again.
You should see her dance round the bear, when I bring him in!
The cavalcade fell into a trot, Mr. May shaking rather badly.
Without him the company is ruinedâ€”until I get a substitute.
He did not care very much whether he found his friend or not.
But for the sake of my honour, finish this week at Woodhouse.
Ciccio was just putting on the outer cover of his front tire.
â€œWhat have I said all along?â€  James was laid on the sofa.
James started and muttered, but did not regain consciousness.
â€œHe canâ€™t rise much because of me, can he?â€  â€œHow not?
Madame went into the drawing-room to smoke her sly cigarette.
Really, I donâ€™t know at allâ€”â€ Mr. May was most freezing.
But the question was, how much did â€œeverythingâ€ amount to?
â€œTell him what sort of a bag, Miss Houghton,â€ said Madame.
So she fancies it.â€  â€œCan we pay her expenses?â€ said Max.
Alvina stooped and crouched under the right arm of Pacohuila.
I donâ€™t like â€™em cominâ€™ in anâ€™ goinâ€™ out, you know.
â€œIâ€™d better fetch some things, hadnâ€™t I?â€ said Alvina.
His remoteness, his southernness, something velvety and dark.
He laughed too, and picked up her bag as if it were a bubble.
Geoffrey was standing monumental between her and the company.
Fortunately for them, Madame had seen to their table-manners.
She knew she would have to break her own trance of obstinacy.
Perhaps even something might be done about the cinematograph.
He took to the attentive study of his finger-nails once more.
â€œWhat barrow-load of poison is that!â€ repeated the doctor.
I may be moved any day now.â€  â€œWellâ€”!â€ said the matron.
â€œOh, but so many things happen outside oneâ€™s imagination.
It might just as wellâ€”â€  Alvina would laugh and get tired.
Gleams, flashes, noises and then at last the frenzy of Paris.
His face was pale, he had that sombre, haunted, unhappy look.
She was thinking how she would be â€œmore comfortableâ€ here.
Then he disappeared, returning in a few moments with the ass.
There were two high white beds on opposite sides of the room.
She felt vaguely that Ciccio was miserable, and wondered why.
And then, screaming high in dialect, Maria would talk to her.
She saw the snow-ridges flare with evening, beyond his cheek.
She sat and cried over the first she found: heaven knows why.
Death and eternity were settled down on her as she sat alone.

The execution is a minor matter.â€  Chester looked thoughtful.
He told me he washed his hands of me.â€  Chester looked sober.
â€œYes, Mr. Tripp.â€  â€œI canâ€™t understand it, for my part.
The distance by rail from Wyncombe to New York is fifty miles.
And how do you like my quarters?â€  â€œThey are very pleasant.
â€œI will go in and introduce you.â€  They entered the office.
â€œNo.â€  â€œWhen will he be in?â€  â€œCanâ€™t say, I am sure.
Obviously the receipt belonged to James Long, who had lost it.
â€œI guess you are used to babies,â€ said the mother, pleased.
â€œI would, but I am to meet a friend uptown at six oâ€™clock.
Though well convinced of it, he wished to find out positively.
He has tried two boys since, but doesnâ€™t seem to get suited.
But how did he happen to call on you?â€  â€œThere you have me.
He felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once.
He wished this to be an agreeable surprise at some future day.
About six oâ€™clock one afternoon Chester knocked at his door.
My mother is naturally cautious, and would not give it to him.
â€œHow much is the fare to Tacoma from this point?â€ he asked.
It was clear that adversity had strengthened and improved him.
And yet, his curious refinement and enthusiasm bore them away.
But still he believed in his own excellence: and quite justly.
She brought in flowers and books, and, very rarely, a visitor.
Luckily, he sold one machine and even gained two pounds on it.
â€œWhat!â€ said a collier to his wife: â€œhave we got no coal?
â€œOh well, if she _does_â€”â€ said Miss Pinnegar cryptically.
And in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy, shabby.
â€œI canâ€™t see what it is to laugh at,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Thatâ€™s where he gets his ideasâ€”out of whiskeyâ€”or brandy!
_Still_, she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority.
These were his childrenâ€”most curious chips of the old block.
She liked taking a walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion.
He mounted the steps, still holding his bunch of white stocks.
â€œWell,â€ said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered.
He annoyed her a little, by being completely oblivious of her.
And she, obedient, began to tie the bandage with numb fingers.
She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him.
â€œAnd is there need to understand the other?â€  â€œCertainly.
â€œDonâ€™t you want your dinner, Alvina?â€ she said at length.
They wanted to examine my private morals, for eugenic reasons.
â€œI hope youâ€™ll go further than _thinking_,â€ said Mr. May.
I can dance today.â€  â€œI donâ€™t think today,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou wonâ€™t have to dance,â€ said Geoffrey out of the bear.
I am practical impracticallyâ€”â€ she stumbled over the words.
Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.
But perhaps to you it is kind.â€  â€œThank you,â€ said Alvina.
There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.
â€œGeoffrey ought to know,â€ said Madame, looking at Geoffrey.
His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.
She heard Miss Pinnegarâ€™s scarcely audible step approaching.
I wouldnâ€™t think of it.â€ He turtled like an injured pigeon.
â€œWhat makes you feel so sure about it?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know.
He looked up, with a faint smile, from under his black lashes.
And will you hang your coat in the hall?â€ she said to Ciccio.
â€œAt any rate I know now,â€ she said, in rather a flat voice.
â€œAnd if there is nothing, what do you intend?â€ said Madame.
Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.
â€œOld pasteâ€”old pasteâ€”antiqueâ€”â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Then she looked into Alvinaâ€™s eyes, really a little jealous.
â€œLâ€™allÃ©e italienne!â€ he said, and shouted with laughter.
Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.
Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.
Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.
So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.
Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.â€  â€œDonâ€™t say so!
Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.
â€œAnd where are the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras this week?â€ he asked.
She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.
â€œI am staying with friends, here and there, for a few weeks.
â€œIâ€™m afraid there is nothing very pleasant, unfortunately.
In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.
I must go this afternoon.â€  â€œOn account of your engagement?
â€œYou couldnâ€™t have anything more wholesome and nourishing.
More cumbers I sell, more graft for you, â€™cordinâ€™ to that.
He could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion.
He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.
â€œOh, it will be over in six weeks,â€ said the doctor easily.
Donâ€™t think about it.â€  He caught her hand and clung to it.
â€œI shall _never_ marry him.â€  â€œAh, never is a long while!
â€˜_O Richard, O mon roi!_â€™â€”â€  But the music had stopped.
Nothing will sing if youâ€™re there,â€ called the young woman.
Do let me see him.â€  â€œDo you really want to?â€ said Alvina.
Ciccio shifted on his feet, watching Alvina pour out the port.
He pointed to the harbour clockâ€”it was ten minutes past ten.
So she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin.
â€œI couldnâ€™t get a cart to come down,â€ he said in English.
â€œThey are doing some washing,â€ said Pancrazio, explanatory.
Pancrazio seized the leading rope angrily and turned upstream.
And then again they struck off to the right, under some trees.
They loved her that she would strip maize-cobs or pick acorns.
â€œIf you are very long,â€ she said, â€œI shall go to England.
In the twilight he came to her, when she could hardly see him.

â€œWell, I have an idea,â€ answered Abel, in a mysterious tone.
As they passed Lord & Taylorâ€™s, a lady came out of the store.
â€œWhat?â€ queried the bookkeeper, evidently taken by surprise.
The shriek comes, so the doctor tells us, from a nervous spasm.
I am quite flattered at the opportunity of posing as a teacher.
â€œIn about two weeks, Mr. Fairchild is going West on business.
It was really a diamond, and he had often found it serviceable.
Is Tiffanyâ€™s near here?â€  â€œYes, sir; only two blocks away.
â€œYe-es.â€  â€œHow did you know that I was coming to New York?
â€œI will only say that I am glad to meet you.â€  â€œThank you!
â€œYou are misinformed about my wanting to locate in this city.
Usually the bookkeeper did not show up till half an hour later.
â€œGo after him!â€ he said, in a low voice, indicating Ralston.
â€œItâ€™s aâ€”lie!â€ exclaimed the gambler, but he turned pale.
â€œAre you sick?â€  â€œYes, sick at heart,â€ was the sad reply.
He attributed this to my influence over her, but it was not so.
â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter with me,â€ rejoined Mr. Wilson.
That shows he is satisfied with you.â€  â€œI try to please him.
â€œâ€˜I shall not require your services any longer,â€™ he said.
â€œI hope I see you well, maâ€™am,â€ he said, bobbing his head.
â€œAbout three weeks,â€ answered Floyd, in an embarrassed tone.
I have been assisted by a fortunate investment in outside lots.
What he failed to perceive was that the crowd hated excellence.
The whole morale of the house rested immediately on Miss Frost.
But still, the two unprotected ones must be sheltered from him.
He had desisted from â€œcreations.â€ Time now for a new flight.
The square green emerald on her finger was almost non-sensical.
It was as if she found her busy contact with life a strain now.
Inwardly, Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from questioning.
There was an inflexible fate within her, which shaped her ends.
And Alvina cried also: she did not quite know why or wherefore.
And then he came out with the most original of all his schemes.
Heâ€™s out of his mindâ€”and itâ€™s drink; thatâ€™s what it is!
As soon as James came in to a meal, the two women attacked him.
She would pitch her dead negative will obstinately against him.
He knew he would have to sacrifice Miss Pinnegarâ€™s work-room.
Lottie Witham came to tea, and was shown over Manchester House.
She began to laugh nervously and hurriedly at the very thought.
â€œNo, itâ€™s not that!â€ hurriedly expostulated Miss Pinnegar.
â€œFather is in.â€  â€œYes, I donâ€™t mind,â€ he said, pleased.
â€œDo you think so?â€ he replied, again with the excited smile.
So she brought him a light, whilst he examined his broken shin.
â€œThat gives you what for,â€ he said, as if it were her fault.
Now Mr. Mayâ€™s mind, though quick, was pedestrian, not winged.
â€œWith a monthâ€™s notice on either hand?â€ continued Mr. May.
And the things she said reminded Alvina so often of Miss Frost.
donâ€™t you think so?â€ And he rolled his eyes oddly to heaven.
But it merely meant that James was having the time of his life.
It was not till later in the evening that he relaxed this rule.
The film is only pictures, like pictures in the _Daily Mirror_.
The chemist was gone to Chapelâ€”he wouldnâ€™t open till eight.
Alvina brushed out the long black hair, and plaited it lightly.
Mrs. Rollings is warming a blanketâ€”â€  Alvina ran downstairs.
He did not say a word, but held aloof as he walked with Alvina.
â€œYou are an Englishwoman, severe and materialist,â€ she said.
â€œCome!â€ said Madame, stretching out her plump jewelled hand.
â€œYou are better, dear Madame?â€ he said, smiling long at her.
The morning was faintly sunny, after the sleet and bad weather.
Ciccio springs forward and stabs the bear, then closes with it.
It was wonderful how well the men played their different parts.
â€œI do think you go on in the most unattractive way sometimes.
On the contrary, I think it is unkind for you also, this place.
â€œYou see I didnâ€™t care for the Woodhouse young men, either.
â€œExcuse my intruding on your mirth!â€ He looked archly round.
His hand started, dropped the cigarette, but was not withdrawn.
â€œI say, Cicâ€™â€”â€ he said, â€œwhy did you change the scene?
Try.â€  â€œI know they are,â€ said Alvina, laughing confusedly.
â€œIâ€™m all right, I tell you,â€ said James, his eyes flaring.
â€œYes,â€ she whispered involuntarily, soulless, like a victim.
â€œOh my dear, we shall be too muchâ€”â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Francesco Marascaâ€”Neapolitan.â€  â€œMarasca!â€ echoed Alvina.
There were substantial bills owing on account of the Endeavour.
That is too rich.â€  Max went off into a high and ribald laugh.
â€œIâ€™m afraid I shall never be particular enough,â€ she said.
â€œPlease donâ€™t come,â€ she said, turning at the street door.
She preferred his tawny eyes with their black brows and lashes.
And a good-humoured, half-mocking smile came over his face too.
And all the time he watched her curiously, from his large eyes.
â€œI didnâ€™t know thereâ€™d be two of you,â€ was her greeting.
â€œCiccio came to carry my bag.â€  â€œOh,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œYou are going to take a hand?â€  â€œCards on Sunday evening!
And you two are cycling back to the camp of KishwÃ©gin tonight?
She doesnâ€™t want a tame bear.â€ He smiled down on his friend.
â€œI will give you another pillow.â€  She led the way upstairs.
â€œPerhaps you would rather decide later.â€  â€œNo,â€ she said.
She knew her own position with the troupe would be humiliating.
Then she sent Max over to Mansfield, on some fictitious errand.
No doubt about it, the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were under suspicion.
She had no serious acquaintance with anybody, she was too busy.
â€œYou look tired this morning,â€ he barked at her one hot day.
â€œMy business is whatâ€™s wrong with the stomach it goes into.
He went into the matronâ€™s room, and asked for Nurse Houghton.
â€œBut put that aside,â€ he smiled again, a little dangerously.
Every one looked round, including the laden, tramping soldiers.
The matron had known Walter Pater, in the somewhat remote past.
His throbbing, muscular power seemed completely to envelop her.
â€œI understood one line,â€ said Effie, making big eyes at him.
Youâ€™re just at the mercy of _Forces_,â€ she shrieked angrily.
â€œOh God, itâ€™s an accursed fugue!â€ cried the bemused Tommy.
There she sat, stranded in the dismalness, and knew no way out.
Ciccio looked up and down for Pancrazio, but could not see him.
They came down to the level valley bed, and went rolling along.
There was a battered photograph of Lord Leighton, among others.
Two men stood below, amid the crumbling of finely falling snow.
â€œThey will come every day now, till Christmas,â€ said Ciccio.
â€˜Yes!â€™ I said, â€˜I will.â€™ So he tied me up on the cross.
There, in the level region, boys were snowballing and shouting.
â€˜Aidsâ€™ from the city of London are to be treated similarly.
The style cultivated by this focus is ornamental and elaborate.

The English renaissance never entirely evacuated this position.
There is no such pinch   peney on live as this good fellowe is.
In fact, he never quite got over being a professor of rhetoric.
To Boethius, weeping in prison, came Philosophy to console him.

It cheered him to think he was earning something, however small.
Butâ€”perhaps your parents might object.â€  â€œI have no father.
When he tendered the five-dollar bill Silas Tripp looked amazed.
He didnâ€™t pay you much wages, though.â€  â€œNo; he feels poor.
It will take all you can earn to pay your own way in a big city.
â€œYou are going to live in New York, arenâ€™t you?â€ asked Rob.
â€œYour future employer is Clement Fairchild,â€ said the artist.
Business men sometimes have a prejudice against outside workers.
A boy needs more pocket money now than he did fifteen years ago.
There seemed to be more books than Chester had ever seen before.
â€œYou ought to wear spectacles,â€ he said, â€œlike uncle Edgar.
Perhaps his friend the artist helps him.â€  â€œNo, he doesnâ€™t.
â€œCan I sell you a house this morning?â€  â€œWell, not exactly.
What sort of a boy is Felix?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know him very well.
Then you will earn more money from him.â€  â€œThank you, Arthur.
What would Silas Tripp say to that or his enemy, the bookkeeper.
â€œWhere do you wish me to work?â€ asked Chester, after a pause.
He lost no time in securing it and moving his few belongings in.
To us it is not important, as we have plenty of capital offered.
Perhaps heâ€™ll know of some cheap place where I can get dinner.
We can chat for an hour, and then go to dinner.â€  â€œThank you.
â€œWell, Mullins,â€ said the gambler, â€œI am getting impatient.
Better send Felix to the bank.â€  â€œBetter wait a little while.
I wouldnâ€™t have seen you suffer.â€  â€œI didnâ€™t like to ask.
He was feeling rather depressed when Chester came into his room.
â€œI ought to go out there, but you know how small my salary is.
â€œThat means a glass of whisky, doesnâ€™t it?â€ returned Floyd.
â€œI will not utterly ignore him.â€  â€œVery well, Mrs. Trimble.
She stepped into Silas Trippâ€™s store to buy a pound of butter.
The widder says sheâ€™s cominâ€™ back, but I donâ€™t believe it.
Between you and me, Mr. Tripp, I wonder that she stayed so long.
She developed heart disease, as a result of nervous repressions.
Meanwhile the shops began to take on a hopeless and frowsy look.
They could have bought a tie for four-three from James Houghton.
She seemed to laugh with a certain proud, sinister recklessness.
She wondered how he could have the slightest attraction for her.
She herself had come fully to believe that she did not love him.
But she had heard Alexander speak of Nurse This and Sister That.
Somewhat to her amazement, he sat steadily on for days and days.
Perhaps it acted like a tonic on the little devil in her breast.
Well, so she was, in the more-or-less exhausted part of herself.
She would be independent, she could laugh every one in the face.
Never had the common ugliness of Woodhouse seemed so entrancing.
It was to be fitted up as a sort of elegant lounging restaurant.
I havenâ€™t time, really.â€  â€œTime!â€ exclaimed Arthur rudely.
You neednâ€™t be afraid.â€  â€œBut Iâ€™m not afraid,â€ she said.
The idea is common to humanity, once youâ€™ve put it into words.
Thereâ€™s something missingâ€”â€ Again he looked towards Alvina.
I keep myself busy.â€  â€œWhat are your subjects?â€ asked James.
â€œWe sâ€™ll have folks talking.â€  Suddenly she began to laugh.
â€œItâ€™s all off,â€ said Alvina, breaking into a nervous laugh.
Anyway it would be some sort of an adventure: better than a job.
There was something odd and integral about him, which she liked.
Im gesicht schon graue Flecken Ach, das muss im Spiegel stecken.
â€œAbout being able to buy it,â€ said Mr. May, a little testily.
She imagined herself dressing up with most priceless variations.
Miss Pinnegar was rather stiff with him and he did not like her.
On the Monday morning there was a rehearsal, Mr. May conducting.
They had a most irritable professional vanity, and that was all.
He was about fifty years old, still handsome, and growing stout.
â€œBien sÃ»r, Madame.â€  â€œCiccio, a button off thy shirt-cuff.
It is there, in the silk bag.â€  â€œI will do it,â€ said Alvina.
They nodded with slow gravity, as if they were already _braves_.
â€œNaples,â€ he said, looking down at her sideways, searchingly.
â€œWhat?â€  â€œThey say â€˜See Naples and die,â€™â€ she laughed.
I canâ€™t understand, myself, how people can go on liking shows.
Pigâ€™s-head, if that seems more suitable to you.â€  â€œTo whom?
â€œBut would he abandon you all without a word?â€ cried Mr. May.
â€œBastaâ€”had enough,â€ said Ciccio, with an invisible grimace.
â€œAre you getting ready to go?â€ she said, looking down at him.
His eye had wandered uncomfortably up to a portrait on the wall.
â€œI suppose theyâ€™re going this morning,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
But I doubt if itâ€™ll do any good.â€  â€œDo you?â€ said Alvina.
On Wednesday night there was another sensation at the Endeavour.
He took off his hat to Alvina, smiled slightly as he passed her.
Hein?â€  â€œYesâ€”certainlyâ€”if it matters,â€ said poor Alvina.
Sheâ€™s a bit like her father in the business lineâ€”all flukes.
Her big cousin sat opposite herâ€”how she disliked his presence.
But Ciccio, most uncomfortable in his four-wheeler, kept hidden.
â€œCome, daughter of the Tawaras,â€ said Madame brightly to her.
â€œWaste so much money?â€  Ciccio raised his shoulders slightly.
â€œI would like to see how it is, there, _chez elle_,â€ he said.
Eh?â€  He was smiling with a thick, doubtful, half sullen smile.
Ciccio took off his coat and sat down in Mr. Houghtonâ€™s chair.
But still they were far too free and easy to suit Miss Pinnegar.
Ciccio sat down almost like a husbandâ€”as if it were his right.
She wondered if she ought to appear before the board in uniform.
It put him in a black rage to have his great manliness insulted.
Fresh cumbers!_â€ yelled the man,  Dr. Mitchell started his car.
When he was gone, the matron looked demure, and Alvina confused.
â€œWell, I _suppose_ it is all right,â€ said the matron gravely.
I may be transferred for war service.â€  â€œThatâ€™s not likely.
Youâ€™re our only maternity nurseâ€”â€  And so the days went by.
He could hear the stifled cries and exclamations from Mrs. Tuke.
The passengers glanced at them across the magic of estrangement.
Alvina, thrilled by the southern country, was smiling excitedly.
He had built a house on the land left by Ciccioâ€™s grandfather.
Alvina was so tired she could hardly climb down to the platform.
Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow.
You will see how you like it.â€  She wondered at his uneasiness.
Ciccio sat on the settle beside her, and ate in large mouthfuls.
Sometimes Alvina and Pancrazio were late returning with the ass.
He came straight towards her, smiling his slow, enigmatic smile.
â€œAnd I shall have to stay here?â€  He nodded, rather gloomily.
Her eyes, watching him, were vulnerable as if stricken to death.
The third section of the book is mainly concerned with revision.
The poet has greater license in compounding and inventing words.
In _The Arcadian Rhetorike_ (1588), Abraham Fraunce treats both.
This is significant of a direct contact with classical rhetoric.
Ascham represents the advance guard in England against allegory.
In this division he provides for narrative, drama, and allegory.
The best classical treatments of style are to be found in Arist.

â€œI am aâ€”a capitalist, and sometimes speculate in real estate.

He saw that his mother was easier in mind, and this relieved him.
Just one little glass.â€  â€œYou can put that off till afterward.
â€œI believe you wish to execute a will, Mrs. Trimble?â€ said he.
â€œIn the event of my sonâ€™s death,â€ interpolated Mrs. Trimble.
He may have reached one by swimming.â€  This was news to Trimble.
His wife was left alone with her baby and the built-in furniture.
And besides, good sound stuff it was, no matter what the pattern.
She could never get over her nervous apprehension of an invasion.
The women of Woodhouse came at last to _depend_ on Miss Pinnegar.
His shop, already only half its original size, was again too big.
He met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway.
But alasâ€”it is wearying to repeat the same thing over and over.
She felt him a terrible outsider, an inferior, to tell the truth.
â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina, still more archly and brightly.
Alvina declared her intention of departing to this training home.
A trained mid-wife.â€  â€œYes, of course,â€ said Alvina brightly.
But instead of being repelled and heartbroken, Alvina enjoyed it.
She never made you feel for an instant that she was one with you.
And sometimes they looked pathetic, with a mute, stricken appeal.
Do you sleep here by yourself?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Alvina laughing.
You can put a chain round its neck, and tie it up,â€ he retorted.
â€œWhy should you mean anything by them!â€ He smiled down on her.
You pledge yourself to nothingâ€”you donâ€™t compromise yourself.
â€œI canâ€™t imagine,â€ said Alvina, laughing at the comic sight.
â€œI do wonder who he can be,â€ murmured Miss Pinnegar miserably.
Very nice man.â€  â€œRather short and dressed in grey?â€  â€œYes.
â€œSheâ€™s in London.â€  â€œWhy not speak of her?â€ asked Alvina.
She was extremely niceâ€”oh, much too nice with the female turns.
There was Jamesâ€™s face peeping inside the little ticket-window.
She felt he was smiling horribly all the time: lewd, unthinkable.
â€œOh, I donâ€™t think you should trouble to do that,â€ she said.
They were to obey Max, she said, for he was their eldest brother.
â€œBut nowâ€”you do,â€ he said, lurching round a corner with her.
Curious how _dark_ they seemed, with only a yellow ring of pupil.
He was looking right into her, beyond her usual self, impersonal.
â€œA dirty Eyetalian,â€ said Max, in English, turning to Mr. May.
â€œThey were always good friends.â€  They all looked at Geoffrey.
He liked the Italian, but he never looked on him as a permanency.
How humble and remote she seemed, as across a chasm from the men.
Câ€™est trop fort, voyez!â€ And she sniggered with fear and sobs.
Ciccio rose, threw his cigarette into the fire, and looked round.
It was covered with white wreaths and streamers of purple ribbon.
â€œWhat there will be when everything is settled, I donâ€™t know.
Lâ€™allÃ©eâ€”â€  There came a great burst of laughter from Louis.
â€œYou make it hard for _me_, in Woodhouse,â€ she said, hopeless.
â€œEverything.â€  â€œReally!â€ Mr. May seemed smitten quite dumb.
â€œI feel as if the world had suddenly come to an end,â€ he said.
Ciccio returned shortly, and stood in the doorway looking at her.
Perhaps you might retain a lease of Miss Pinnegarâ€™s work-rooms.
He had a large practice among the poor, and was an energetic man.
Which finger is it?â€ he asked, beginning to smile rather weakly.
Alvina slept in her house these days, instead of at the hospital.
â€œYouâ€™ve had some effect on him, thatâ€™s evident,â€ she said.
â€œWhy I want you?â€ He gave a curious laugh, almost of ridicule.
Was it atavism, this strange, sleep-like submission to his being?
She felt she could sink forever into his warm, pulsating embrace.
But we must leave the cart.â€  Ciccio asked questions in Italian.
The men in the room stared, but went on noisily with their cards.
Only there was a film of wood-smoke in the room, rather smarting.
Nothing could have been more marvellous than the winter twilight.
He seemed, in his silence, to _concentrate_ upon her so terribly.
What was to be done, then, on mornings that were dark with sleet?
â€œThey give so freely.â€  But Ciccio smiled a wry smile, silent.
â€œIâ€™m not sorry,â€ she answered slowly, using all her courage.
For quotations difficult of access I add the Latin in a footnote.
Aristotle's _Poetics_ discusses only epic and, especially, drama.
It included all of what to-day we might call working up the case.
Brunette Latini translated seventeen chapters of it into Italian.
The rhetorical character of these poetical models is significant.

On 11 August, 1715, there was a revival at Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields.

â€œOho, thatâ€™s what youâ€™re after, is it?â€ said Silas, grimly.
He went about his work in a mechanical way, but neglected nothing.
â€œDo you ever contribute to these papers, Mr. Conrad?â€ he asked.
â€œYou have no property to dispose of by will?â€ asked the doctor.
â€œFour dollars, my dear madam!â€  â€œDo you consider it too much?
He ainâ€™t got no push, and heâ€™s allus forgettinâ€™ his errands.
He sat on a high stool, but he was only reading the morning paper.
â€œBut that would be a mean thing to do,â€ said Chester, startled.
â€œI will tell you, sir,â€ said the bookkeeper, with an ugly look.
Chester must have chanced upon the receipt and carried it to Long.
â€œBorrow a little money from the office,â€ answered Dick, coolly.
Before relating what followed, a word of explanation is necessary.
When he had gone, Ralston said, â€œWho is that, Mullins?â€  â€œMr.
He did not care to have him speak so freely before the office boy.
He entered the office and glanced about, expecting to see Chester.
And I am to have twenty-five dollars forâ€”â€”â€  â€œYour trouble.
â€œAs well as I ever expect to be,â€ answered Mrs. Trimble, sadly.
â€œOne year would be sufficient, it seems to me,â€ put in Trimble.
Floyd looked up in surprise, but did not comprehend the situation.
Yes.â€  â€œWell, Chesterâ€™s bought it.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t mean it!
James Houghton cried, and put a black band on his Sunday silk hat.
All seemed straightforwardâ€”not _very_ cordial, but sufficiently.
She wanted to cry, and fling herself on the breast of her darling.
The mighty question arises upon us, what is oneâ€™s own real self?
They were luminous and crystalline, like the eyes of a changeling.
For a little while Alvina flaunted about in her nurseâ€™s uniform.
Alvina followed them persistently, but a little aloof, and silent.
She was completely indifferent to sight-seeing and scouring about.
She kept on wondering what she should do if he wanted to kiss her.
Witham was here till ten minutes ago.â€  â€œYes,â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œHow do you explain such behaviour?â€ said her father pettishly.
Have you got a handkerchief?â€  â€œItâ€™s in my jacket,â€ he said.
Every individual should, by nature, have his extraordinary points.
In the background were two booths covered up with coloured canvas.
He looked at himself sideways, and feared dismally he was thinner.
I wonder what it can be.â€  â€œI havenâ€™t an idea,â€ said Alvina.
And she gave a queer, sharp little rap on the table with her hand.
â€œI told you I had bought a cinematograph building,â€ said James.
â€œShe isnâ€™t indispensable.â€  And Alvina was to play the piano!
But he was very happy sitting chatting tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Alvina.
Miss Poppyâ€™s professional virginity was thus saved from outrage.
â€œMy young men drink a little beer, after their horrible journey.
Well, then when shall I dance?â€  Alvina turned and looked at her.
They are dead.â€  â€œAnd you wander about the worldâ€”â€ she said.
They had all disappeared over the brow of Lumley Hill, descending.
Why are they?â€  â€œI suppose they canâ€™t help it,â€ said Alvina.
â€œDonâ€™tâ€”!â€ she cried, lifting her hand to stop his progress.
He departed on his nine mile ride through the rain to Knarborough.
It might have spoiled everything if Madame wasnâ€™t such a genius.
From which?â€  â€œDonâ€™t give me anything, please,â€ said Alvina.
Then he swung round the bicycle, and stood it again on its wheels.
â€œIf _thatâ€™s_ what youâ€™ve seen in him!â€â€”there was a pause.
Poor thing, left aloneâ€”and hardly a penny to bless herself with.
But he felt it in his flesh, the harshness and discomfort of them.
â€œCiccio didnâ€™t come to see you, hein?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
â€œAnother four thousand francs there,â€ she said, nodding sagely.
Well, â€™s a strappinâ€™ anuff feller, for them as goes that road.
If she could have imagined how far he was from any such intention.
But he confronted her like a powerful ox, full of dangerous force.
Miss Pinnegar expected Alvina, but by the train, which came later.
Iâ€™ve lived here all my life and seen everything bad happen here.
â€œWell I think itâ€™s been a most agreeable game,â€ said Mr. May.
â€œNot many more times here, eh?â€ he said, smiling significantly.
He can never have left things so bad.â€  â€œCiccio,â€ said Alvina.
Miss Pinnegar could answer her own fate according to its question.
And she guarded her money, and watched for some other opportunity.
But soon she realized that they loved itâ€”particularly the women.
Yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor, they had to submit.
Heâ€™s got the biggest understandinâ€™s of any man iâ€™ Lancaster.
Alvina glanced at her, flushed crimson and looked down to the man.
â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ cried Mrs. Tuke, cocking her head on one side.
He slowly relaxed his clasp, and she slid down like rain to earth.
â€œI canâ€™t, I think,â€ she said abstractedly, looking up at him.
The depth of his warm, mindless, enveloping love was immeasurable.
The train seemed to rush ponderously, massively, across the Weald.
Nobody asked her anythingâ€”she might have been Ciccioâ€™s shadow.
Near ChambÃ©ry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car.
Ciccio became excited as they neared Modane, the frontier station.
And Alvina settled her cushion, and slept more or less till Genoa.
Vecchio!â€ nodding violently and indicating that she should drink.
The group with the lantern moved again upstream, becoming smaller.
â€œI had better go upstairs and take my things off,â€ said Alvina.
The lovely, pristine morning of the world, before our epoch began.
It is a text-book of rhetoric which was used in the Roman schools.
This he does in his famous differentiation of rhetoric and poetic.
A Turk believes that all water is purified after running six feet.
Supper was not yet over, for we caught a whiff of its savory odor.
But here on the desert we could buy nothing but very coarse flour.
In its present condition the Great Wall belongs to various epochs.
At several points along the route we were delayed on this account.
Finally we were obliged to admit that sometimes such was the case.
Sir _Timothy Tawdrey_, a Fop-Knight, designâ€™d to marry _Celinda_.
Ay, _Frank_, ay--is she not a pretty little plump white Rogue, hah?
No matter for his Handsomness, let me have him that has most Money.
Eâ€™en your trusty and well-beloved Friend, Mrs. _Driver_ the Baud.
What--the Goldsmith paid the Money at sight, without demanding why?
Agues, Sir, are kind Diseases, they allow of Truces and Cessations.
Or else, two Morning Stars, All other Beauties are but Soot to her.
Why, any _Antonio_; all the _Antonioâ€™s_ that you find in _Cadiz_.

_Falatius_, a fantastick Courtier,                     Mr. _Angel_.
Sleep, and _Erminia_ have abandonâ€™d me; Iâ€™ll never sleep again.

No, Iâ€™ll let it run to its extent, And see what then â€˜twill do.

Oh, â€˜twas an idle lying one, _Pisaro_, And came but to intrap me.
It is very doubtful if the theatre existed as such later than 1779.
But do you imagine, Sir, they will fall in love with an old Mortal?

Antony Leigh, the famous comedian, who created Sir Feeble Fainwood.
â€œIâ€™m goinâ€™ to work in your place Monday morninâ€™,â€ he said.
â€œHas Mr. Tripp spoken to you?â€ asked Chester, his heart sinking.
When Monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted.
â€œHow long have you been drawing?â€  â€œEver since I can remember.
Even his mother thought of it only as a pleasant diversion for him.
He is my uncle.â€  â€œYour uncle!â€ exclaimed Chester, in surprise.
They thought the other might refer to a ring or some small article.
â€œHowâ€™s your mother this morninâ€™, Chester?â€ asked the grocer.
â€œI donâ€™t care to sell, Mr. Tripp,â€ said Mrs. Rand, decisively.
â€œI came here by way of Pittsburg,â€ answered the tramp, coughing.
â€œHow did he know about my store?â€ demanded Silas, incredulously.
â€œI donâ€™t see how I can spare you, Chester,â€ she said, soberly.
An hour glided by rapidly, and then a step was heard on the stairs.
â€œI shall be glad to pay you any attentions,â€ insinuated Ralston.
New Yorkâ€™s a right smart place, I admit, but give me Minneapolis.
He knew now that he would be able to support himself and more, too.
Are you trying to get a place?â€  â€œNo.â€  Felix looked surprised.
I am Mr. Mullins, his bookkeeper, and represent him.â€  â€œJust so!
He did not seem strong, and there was a sad expression on his face.
Miss Frost, hearing this legend, looked sideways at the enthusiast.
What money she made went chiefly to support the Houghton household.
There are such poles of opposition between honesties and loyalties.
The shop seemed to have digested some of its indigestible contents.
â€œWeâ€™re more than friends.â€  â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ she said.
And then, most irritating, a complete _volte face_ in her feelings.
â€œBecause you donâ€™t understand what it means,â€ said her father.
I canâ€™t understand it.â€  â€œCanâ€™t you?â€ said Alvina brightly.
Purity and high-mindednessâ€”the beautiful, but unbearable tyranny.
His strength was so different from hersâ€”quick, muscular, lambent.
For well-to-do mothers she would charge from three to five guineas.
Her greatest horror was lest her husband should come into the room.
In these days Mrs. Houghton never talkedâ€”unless to fret a little.
So Alvina refrained from pondering on her motherâ€™s life and fate.
And perhaps neither of them knew that the intimacy itself had gone.
â€œIt wonâ€™t be done for nothing,â€ he said, looking at her again.
And Miss Pinnegar and I canâ€™t have anything to do with it anyway.
Alvina was asked back to teaâ€”on Wednesday afternoon, closing day.
I canâ€™t stand him.â€  â€œWhy?â€”suddenlyâ€”â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Between her and the Woodhouse Withams there was a decided coldness.
â€œThere is no need to make provision for me,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
He brushed his crisp, curly brown hair carefully before the mirror.
â€œOf course we can _delay_ for some time, until I get my supplies.
So they watched like cats for their manâ€™s return, at dinner-time.
â€œTheyâ€™ve stopped again,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, recalling Alvina.
how awful it was!â€  â€œWhy?â€  â€œThere was no pleasing the woman.
And when do you expect the fittingsâ€”?â€  â€œTomorrow.â€  â€œWhat!
She watched the ladies making upâ€”she gave some slight assistance.
The place was crowded with a whooping, whistling, excited audience.
But his naÃ¯vetÃ© roused the serpentâ€™s tooth of her bitter irony.
Pictures donâ€™t have any life except in the people who watch them.
At that moment she would cheerfully have gone along with the navvy.
Since opening the Pleasure Palace James was less regular at Chapel.
While the interview was going on, Mr. May arrived, full of concern.
Iâ€™ll be KishwÃ©gin.â€ And he bridled and beamed self-consciously.
Louis arose, a _brave_ like Ciccio, in war-paint even more hideous.
Ciccio turned round and looked at them with a sneer along his nose.
You say _love_â€”â€ He raised his shoulders slightly, with a shrug.
For him, it was not yet quite natural to express himself in speech.
â€œBut if Naples is so lovely, how could you leave it?â€ she asked.
He looked at her, and made a slight, sad gesture, indifferent also.
Ciccio was just a fantasy blown in on the wind, to blow away again.
â€œThey are the darkest of all.â€ And she shook her head roguishly.
â€œOh, good morning, Mrs. Rollings!â€ they heard Mr. Mayâ€™s voice.
â€œWonâ€™t you come?â€ she said, smiling and looking into his eyes.
The boy was sent for the cab, James swallowed a spoonful of brandy.
Right in her bowels she felt itâ€”the terrible, unbearable feeling.
I donâ€™t fancy he would have wanted such people following, myself.
On the next morning she dressed herself carefully in her new dress.
In the first place, you are English, and he thinks to rise by that.
But Madameâ€™s shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off.
And her crying started Miss Pinnegar, who cried almost as bitterly.
But not very much, Iâ€™m sure of that.â€  â€œHow much do you think?
The young men thrust their glasses up towards Alvina, in a cluster.
â€œThe leather is not good in these things of Gigiâ€™s,â€ she said.
â€œYou think itâ€™s strange?â€ he said, showing his teeth slightly.
Salute me, my own friend.â€  And Ciccio kissed him on either cheek.
He threw bedclothes over her and went downstairs, whistling softly.
You are not leaving Woodhouse for ever.â€  â€œGood-bye!â€ she said.
Your money isnâ€™t with his, is it?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
The attendant women threw up their hands and looked at one another.
The doctor began by being rather lordly and condescending with her.
â€œItâ€™s you I _am_ thinking about,â€ she laughed, flirting still.
And she knew well how hateful material circumstances can make life.
She put down her name on the list of volunteers for active service.
Where is your mandoline?â€  He turned round and looked up the road.
Even the will of God is a life-force.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t understand!
â€œYou come, Allaye,â€ he said softly, with his foreign intonation.
After all, he had triumphed over his well-to-do, Anglicized cousin.
Giuseppe had insisted that Ciccio should take second-class tickets.
They were out on the platform again, they had secured their places.
The world is an amazing place.â€  This thought dozed her off again.
It was a wide, strange bed of dry boulders, pallid under the stars.
She was almost stupefied with weariness and the cold, bruising air.
And yet in the whole market-place she was aware of nothing but him.
Alvina hated their Cockney accent and florid showy vulgar presence.
Ciccio was still turning talking in the rapid way to his neighbour.
But there was a great, twin-towered church, wonderful from outside.
â€œBecause I love youâ€”â€  She crouched quite still on the hearth.
Rhetoric sits in a chamber gaily glorified and strewn with flowers.

He worked with a will, and in twenty-five minutes the work was done.
â€œDo you think I shall pull through, doctor?â€ asked the young man.
â€œYes,â€ was the unexpected answer, â€œbut I shall not make a will.
â€œI have no doubt you can do it, for it will not require an expert.

Why didnâ€™t I get the place?â€  â€œYou must ask Mr. Fairchild that.
Chester took notice of the way in order that he might know it again.
He looked with surprise at Chester, not immediately recognizing him.
Youâ€™ve been a good friend to James Long, and he wonâ€™t forget it.
He will bear watching.â€  â€œI wish he were more like Mr. Fairchild.
They had two-dollar seats, and I learned that Chester paid for them.
Did you have the toothache?â€™â€  Chester burst into a hearty laugh.
â€œYouâ€™ll have to settle up soon,â€ said Ralston, in a surly tone.
â€œWhat complaint does Mr. Fairchild make of you?â€  â€œNone at all.
Silas Tripp returned home full of the news he had heard in New York.

But from the first she had a curious ascendancy over James Houghton.
In came the architect, with whom he had played many a game of chess.
Miss Frost was straightforward, good-humoured, and a little earnest.
When she was twenty-three years old, Alvina met a man called Graham.
â€œYes we are,â€ he insisted, trying to put his arm round her waist.
Her father said:  â€œWell, of course, youâ€™ll do as you think best.
â€œOf course you donâ€™t mean it, dear,â€ said Miss Frost, quailing.
Or rather, being sufficiently a woman, she didnâ€™t decide anything.
Oh, itâ€™s easy workinâ€™â€”you donâ€™t have to knock your guts out.
â€œWe can go into that later,â€ said James, leading off the plumber.
Picture her disappointment when she found Albert quite unattractive.
Iâ€™ve got to be in at nine.â€  â€œWhich way shall we go?â€ he said.
â€œI suppose the old connections count for something.â€  â€œThey do.
â€œAs sure as all that, are you!â€ he said, with a sneering grimace.
â€œBecause thereâ€™s no need to understand it,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
None the less, as Christmas drew near Alvina worked up her feelings.
He was becoming really depressed by his failure to find any opening.
But he must perforce keep enough in hand for a ticket to Birmingham.
But this cheerfulness and brisk perkiness was a great strain on him.
Wellâ€”â€ said James vaguely, nervously, giving a glance at Mr. May.
â€œAnd youâ€™ll just retire, and live quietly,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œDonâ€™t you think heâ€™s dreadful?â€ said the poor elderly woman.
â€œCome down, come down!â€ hissed Mr. May frantically from in front.
She was curious to see what Madame and her four young men were like.
Then quick as lightning both turned their attention again to Madame.
â€œCome and put in the flowers,â€ said Mr. May anxiously, to Alvina.
Awful things men were, savage, cruel, underneath their civilization.
And soâ€”in ten yearsâ€™ timeâ€”no more KishwÃ©gin at all.â€  â€œNo.
â€œI should love to be one of the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras,â€ said Alvina.
How submissive she was, with an eternity of inaccessible submission.
I must find you something else.â€  â€œPlease donâ€™t,â€ said Alvina.
HÃ©?â€  â€œThank you _so_ much,â€ said Alvina, holding out her hand.
â€œI enjoy itâ€”and so does father.â€  â€œNo,â€ cried Miss Pinnegar.
â€œDidnâ€™t I say so!â€ said Miss Pinnegar, starting from her chair.
How would you like him then?â€  â€œHe isnâ€™t, is he?â€ said Alvina.
Sheâ€™ll have to go out of Manchester Houseâ€”her and Miss Pinnegar.
â€œShe wants you to get in with her.â€  He looked round at the cabs.
Ciccio, smiling slightly, and keeping his head ducked, took the key.
He sat looking at her with an instant re-establishment of knowledge.
He turned aside his face, as if unwilling to give a straight answer.
A stray cat darted from the scullery, and broke a plate in her leap.
Good-bye!â€  â€œYouâ€™re looking well, Alvina,â€ people said to her.
Slowly she climbed the familiar hillâ€”slowlyâ€”and rather bitterly.
â€œIâ€™d rather not be engaged, under the circumstances,â€ she said.
What does he look like, really?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina.
â€œHave some more!â€ said Effie, watching over the top of her glass.
There was a terrible encumbrance of packages and luggage everywhere.
Geoffrey sobbed, and the tears came silently down Ciccioâ€™s cheeks.
And he sat for the most part impassive and abstract as a Red Indian.
Are you cold?â€ came a loud, raucous, American-Italian female voice.
And then they took a difficult, rocky track ascending between banks.
He pushed his chair among the litter of fire-kindling, and sat down.
He put fresh faggots behind the fireâ€”though Pancrazio forbade him.
â€œWe will make a fire-place in the other bedroom,â€ said Pancrazio.
Ciccio must take her to America, or Englandâ€”to America preferably.
All down the oak-dry bankside they burned their great exposed stars.

Nothing _horrified_ him more than a woman who was coming-on towards him.
Their weight sank sensually into his muscle, and gave him gratification.

She laughed when she saw her fatherâ€™s theatre-notices plastered about.
Their great turn, of course, was the Natcha-Kee-Tawara Red Indian scene.
â€œIâ€™m afraid she will never be able to dance tomorrow,â€ said Alvina.
Donâ€™t die _before_ youâ€™ve seen it.â€ He smiled with a knowing smile.
Crowds of excited, shouting children ran chattering along the pavements.
â€œCan you _believe_ that thatâ€™s Mr. Mayâ€”heâ€™s exactly like a girl.
Youâ€™re a regular spoil-sport.â€  â€œWell,â€ said Miss Pinnegar tartly.
She laughed till her head lay helpless on the chair, she could not move.
Their conversation consisted a good deal in noises variously ejaculated.
To me he looks very ill.â€  â€œFather wears himself away,â€ said Alvina.
â€œI couldnâ€™t imagine who it was.â€ She eyed the young fellow sharply.
â€œI shall be there, Signorino.â€  She spoke with a half-playful threat.
Miss Pinnegar had been so fond of her father, in a quaint, reserved way.
The funeral tea, with its baked meats and sweets, was a terrible affair.
â€œWill you go to Woodhouse tomorrow?â€ Madame asked her, rather coolly.
And yet she went forward to him and stood so that her dress touched him.
She looked aside at the black garden, which had a wiry goose-berry bush.
Here was the strange sphinx singing again, and herself between its paws!
â€œNow I think,â€ said Madame, â€œthat today we all take the same train.
Then you, Allaye, go on to Knarborough, and we leave you until tomorrow.
But her knees were still between the powerful, living vice of his knees.
The whole place is talking already.â€  â€œI donâ€™t care,â€ said Alvina.
â€œIâ€™m ashamed to live another day in Woodhouse,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Then she turned slowly, under the church wall, back to Manchester House.
They seemed to be united into a strong, four-square silence and tension.

I drink a drop oâ€™ beer, if thatâ€™s what you caâ€™ touchinâ€™ alcohol.
My husband says theyâ€™re the best pair oâ€™ pasties iâ€™ thâ€™ kingdom.
And he was a little too loud-mouthedly lordly to be in human good taste.
â€œPerhaps _you_ wouldnâ€™t say so, nurse?â€ he said, turning to Alvina.
She showed Alexander her watchâ€”exactly ten oâ€™clock, instead of nine.
And she submitted to him as if he had extended his dark nature over her.
She thanked the old man, who bowed as if he had a reputation to keep up.
Alvina had never seen people herd about like cattle, dumb, brute cattle.
Veryâ€”_convenient_.â€  He sat up in triumph, having achieved this word.
â€œIf you like,â€ he replied, making an Italian gesture of indifference.
She felt she would die instantly, everything was so terrible around her.

But she was weak and feverish with her cold, which would not get better.
Ciccio came with lettersâ€”long-delayed letters, that had been censored.
She had sixty pounds of her own money, always intact in the little case.

â€œArthur, I am done with Chester for this evening,â€ said the professor.

I might have made something out of him.â€  â€œHe is not your style, Dick.
He was delayed about ten minutes by a block on the Sixth Avenue car line.
â€œIs this the editor of _The Phoenix_?â€ inquired Chester, respectfully.
Look at this!â€ and he showed one of the brown packages partly torn open.
Do you think they suspected anything?â€ he continued, turning to Ralston.
My mother is married again, and my stepfather from the first disliked me.
He asked me if I thought you would come     back for four dollars a week.

â€œOh, well, if youâ€™re so sureâ€”â€ said Miss Pinnegar rather bitingly.
His rather small felt hats still curved jauntily over his full pink face.

People will talk.â€  â€œI should almost feel flattered,â€ laughed Alvina.
He collected all his odds and ends from every corner of Manchester House.
â€œWould you believe it?â€ said Miss Pinnegar, relinquishing it to James.
â€œThere are two kinds of friendships,â€ he said, â€œphysical and mental.
â€œYou say Thursday?â€ There was a note of strong rebellion in her voice.

Five hundred, even two hundred pounds would have made all the difference.
I shall go straight there.â€  â€œWhy canâ€™t you come now?â€ said Ciccio.
While the trouble was hanging over, they seemed to ignore her altogether.
He begins to show some taste at last.â€  â€œThere now!â€ said the matron.
Come now!â€ He smiled imminent, and held out his large hand for her hand.

His constitution was fragile, and the disease had undermined his strength.
What is your address?â€  Chester gave it, and Mr. Fairchild wrote it down.
Still he had his employerâ€™s confidence, and that gave him much pleasure.

â€œAre you fond of the theater?â€  â€œYes, sir,â€ answered Felix, eagerly.
Besides, his income would be largely, at any rate considerably, increased.

She had tea with him practically every afternoon, and she got used to him.
In Woodhouse, she knew, it elevated her in the common esteem tremendously.
â€œNot a bit,â€ said Tommy, laying his hand on the other manâ€™s shoulder.
It was like a long, ash-grey coffin, winter, slowly submerging in the sea.

CHAPTER X THE FALL OF MANCHESTER HOUSE   Alvina rose chastened and wistful.
The odd arch of his eyebrows made him suddenly seem not quite human to her.
â€œI hope not.â€  â€œThank you for the _hope_â€ said Mr. May sarcastically.

However, Ciccio drank up, so Alvina did likewise, burning her lips smartly.
A crowd surged at the post-office door, in a steep, black, wet side-street.
An obstinate spirit made him darkly refuse masculine conversation with her.

Silas Tripp was weighing out some sugar for a customer when Chester entered.
I worked for him once.â€  â€œHow did you like it?â€  â€œIt almost killed me.
Indeed, I am proud of you now.â€  â€œI can hardly realize it myself, mother.
â€œIâ€”I am looking at this sketch,â€ answered Chester, in slight confusion.
In ten minutes a heavy step was heard on the stairs, and James Long entered.
What of him?â€  â€œIt is our bookkeeper, David Mullins.â€  â€œIs it, indeed?
He felt that Mr. Fairchild ought to know it, but he shrank from telling him.
This, to be sure, took all his salary, but he was earning something outside.
He did not wish needlessly to prejudice his employer against the bookkeeper.
â€œHello, Mullins, old boy!â€ said Dick, pushing forward with extended hand.
This, so far as he knew, was the first visit made by Ralston to Mr. Mullins.
â€œThe Fifth Avenue sets a good table.â€  â€œMy appetite is sure to be good.
â€œNo, I think not.â€  â€œWonâ€™t you introduce me to your friend?â€  â€œMr.
Now he is disposed of.â€  â€œI see you are shrewd,â€ said Chester, laughing.
â€œYes, Iâ€™m a little foxy when thereâ€™s occasion,â€ rejoined Mr. Perkins.
â€œI canâ€™t say, but it wouldnâ€™t have been policy to make you acquainted.
Another chance gone, Mullins.â€  The bookkeeper looked warningly at Ralston.
â€œI see you are practical and understand what we want, Mr. Rand,â€ he said.
â€œI took nothing of value,â€ continued Ralston, â€œand you canâ€™t hold me.
â€œMy boy,â€ he said, â€œI shall not soon forget your kindness to my father.
Women folks is mighty onsartin when they make promises.â€  Mrs. Rand smiled.

Sufficient that the girl herself worshipped Miss Frost: or believed she did.
It is truly incredible how Alvina became blooming and bouncing at this time.
Human functions were too obviously established to make any great fuss about.
The battle-spirit was really roused in him, and he heartily liked the woman.
And that was rather irritating to the well-to-do and florid daughter of W.H.
She began to hate outspokenness and direct speaking-forth of the whole mind.
He was a little insolent and condescending to the natives, who disliked him.
When will you have your first lesson?â€  â€œOh,â€ cried Alvina in confusion.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter is that he feels guilty for not knowing his own mind.
And there, through the uncurtained window, she saw him sitting awaiting her.
Itâ€™s all done, but fixing.â€  â€œHadnâ€™t you better leave it,â€ she said.
â€œâ€™Tisnâ€™t fair time, is it?â€  â€œNo, itâ€™s no fair,â€ said the woman.
He missed his eleven oâ€™clock whiskey terriblyâ€”terriblyâ€”his pick-me-up!

When rather drunk, he talked charmingly and amusinglyâ€”oh, most charmingly.

Ciccio made no pretence of listening, but smoked and stared at his own feet.
Mr. Houghton nodded slowly and gravely, as if to give his measured approval.
Itâ€™s interesting in a way, just to show what savage Red-Indians were like.
Geoffrey hurriedly lit his lamp and swung off in the dark back to Woodhouse.
Even I, I donâ€™t know himâ€”no, though he has been with me for three years.
And Mr. May strutted out of the room like a bird bursting with its own rage.
â€œI shall see you soon,â€ he said, smiling sheepishly and bowing to Alvina.
A change does you good.â€  â€œIt does, doesnâ€™t it,â€ said Alvina brightly.
â€œDo you think I might?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina, non-committal.
And he was reaching forward to her as a snake reaches, nor could she recoil.
The women and children kissed Alvina, saying:  â€œYouâ€™ll be all right, eh?
Alvina ventured down the steep descent, Pancrazio following showing a light.
â€œI am so hungry.â€  â€œYou had better keep your coat on,â€ said Pancrazio.
The gods who had demanded human sacrifice were quite right, immutably right.
Pancrazio, Ciccio, Giovanni, Maria and a mason all set about the fire-place.
â€œBut I should have thought that would make them less generous,â€ she said.

What is your address?â€  â€œNumber one ninety-nine West Thirty-fourth Street.
We are not doing very well, as you may imagine.â€  â€œSo I surmised, maâ€™am.
â€œWell, say five dollars a month.â€  â€œAbout sixteen or seventeen per cent.
â€œHow much will you give me if I board at home, Mr. Dexter?â€ asked Chester.
But I didnâ€™t take it.â€  â€œGo for the constable, Abel, and mind you hurry.
Iâ€™d like to know who it is that knows so much about my plans.â€  â€œI will.
Probably you would not find me in.â€  Mr. Perkins was a tolerably shrewd man.
But this is not good work.â€  â€œSir!â€  â€œMy dear sir, donâ€™t be offended.
Perhaps,â€ said Mullins, nervously, â€œwe had better give up the whole thing.
You might have thought me mean.â€  â€œPoor fellow!â€ said Chester, pityingly.
â€œI never thought the country was so large before,â€ said Chester to Edward.

I made a mistake in marrying Mr. Trimble, but it is too late to correct that.
Miss Frost gave a slight gesture with her right hand, of helpless impatience.
How many infernos deeper than Miss Frost could ever know, did she not travel?
She would not intrigue into marriage, or try and make use of them in any way.
But, we must repeat, it was as if the glass wall of an aquarium divided them.
Come down to the Coach Road tomorrow afternoon, and let me give you a lesson.
â€œIâ€™m very much obliged.â€  â€œYou ought to be more than that,â€ she said.
And wages in particularâ€”â€  â€œBut surely Miss Houghton will have her wage.
We donâ€™t get on at _all_ well, she and I.â€  â€œWhat a pity,â€ said Alvina.
All it gave _me_ was gas in the stomach.â€  â€œSo overbearing!â€ said Alvina.

â€œNot without Madame,â€ he said, with the slow, half-sneering, stupid smile.
You can get to know everything about peopleâ€™s actual lives from the cinema.
In Knarborough, I donâ€™t know.â€  â€œHow much money had he?â€ asked Mr. May.
But they will remember.â€  Geoffrey rode swiftly as possible through the mud.
â€œOh well then, in that caseâ€”â€ But he was filled with dismay and chagrin.
â€œI should like that.â€  â€œYes, it is niceâ€”but you donâ€™t know the life.
Why, when he was at Oxford, you know, learning for his head masterâ€™s place.
Shall she be our pianist?â€  The eyes of the four young men rested on Alvina.
â€œAnd the diamonds are real?â€ said Madame, making Alvina hold up her hands.
Really, she had come down in the world, conforming to such standards of life.
Alvina was startled by the deep, mysterious look in his dark-fringed ox-eyes.
â€œNa, Allaye,â€ he said, â€œtell me something.â€  â€œWhat?â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œI wish you would.â€  â€œGood,â€ he said, a broad smile on his thick mouth.

He was leaning forward to her, smiling, self-conscious, tentative, and eager.

â€œI donâ€™t lay no claim to it.â€  â€œThank you,â€ returned Chester, gravely.
â€œI didnâ€™t do it, Mr. Tripp, honest I didnâ€™t,â€ declared Abel, earnestly.
â€œIâ€™ve done nothing to be ashamed of.â€  â€œOh, you hardened young villain.
How old are you?â€  â€œI am almost sixteen.â€  â€œThat is young for an artist.

Chester opened the paper eagerly, for _Puck_ had accepted two of his sketches.
But, Lord, the New York of that day wasnâ€™t a circumstance to what it is now.

â€œWe are only friends.â€  He knew her upbringing was too strong for him also.

The first thing she saw was Louis, in his shirt sleeves, on the landing above.
Look, it is a gift-day for youâ€”â€  Madame smilingly led Alvina to her place.
But Ciccio, with an obstinate and ugly little smile on his face, followed her.
â€œAt four oâ€™clock.â€  â€œJust about the time when we get there,â€ she said.
â€œIf Miss Houghton would just _allow_ me to run round and bring something in.

â€œWhatâ€™s your name?â€  â€œChester Rand.â€  â€œCanâ€™t you give me a quarter?
Two days later Chester found another letter from Mr. Conrad at the post office.
When about eight years of age Chester had made the journey, but not since then.
He asked me to inquire if he left his gloves here?â€  â€œI havenâ€™t found any.
I canâ€™t help it.â€  â€œI think he gives the right explanation,â€ said Arthur.

â€œI congratulate you, Mr. Tripp, on making an unusually profitable investment.

These sales contributed a good deal to Mrs. Houghtonâ€™s nervous heart-disease.
Every morning alike, she felt an invasion of some enemy was breaking in on her.
And so from the first Alvina spoke with a quiet, refined, almost convent voice.
She wanted tacit admission of difference, not open, wholehearted communication.
She was so swift and sensitive in her nursing, she seemed to have second sight.
Alvina kissed her, and could not suppress the whimpering of her too-much grief.
Alvina inherited the few simple trinkets, and about forty-five pounds in money.
At one time he showed the alarming symptom of brooding over his wifeâ€™s death.
The cold and supercilious look of anger, a little spiteful, came into his face.
But how am I to _live_?â€  Jamesâ€™s head still vibrated in a negative fashion.
And for the same wage you could get some unimportant fellow with strong wrists.
â€œWhat a low opinion you have of human nature!â€  â€œHave I?â€ laughed Alvina.
She laughed when she saw his thrilling announcements in the _Woodhouse Weekly_.
â€œItâ€™s this way.â€ She groped for him in the dark, and met his groping hand.
â€œYou have been good to KishwÃ©gin, and KishwÃ©gin has a heart that remembers.
I should be awfully gladâ€”but donâ€™t buyâ€”â€ Alvina checked herself in time.
Itâ€™s all against his better nature.â€  â€œReally!â€ said Alvina, in surprise.
And then he gave the faintest gesture with his head, as of summons towards him.
What is your choice, gentlemen?â€  â€œBeer,â€ said Ciccio, and Geoffrey nodded.
â€œDonâ€™t you see thatâ€™s insulting.â€  â€œ_Insulting!_ Well, I donâ€™t know.
â€œThou art the tame bear of Allaye.â€  Geoffrey strained Ciccio to his breast.
Loveâ€™s young dream is never so delicious as at the virgin age of fifty-three.

â€œWe must get down hereâ€”the cart doesnâ€™t go any further,â€ said Pancrazio.
Then she saw him making his way quickly back through the crowd, to rejoin them.

â€œI have been discharged from my position in the real estate office,â€ he said.
The next day he went to the office of _The Phoenix_ and carried in two sketches.
â€œFelix,â€ said his cousin, â€œyou may keep the office while I go out to lunch.
I wonder what he can be doinâ€™ to get such a high salary.â€     CHAPTER XXVIII.
â€œYou can say that I supervised the illustrations,â€ answered Arthur, demurely.
Do you get fair pay?â€  â€œTwenty-five dollars a week.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t say so.
â€œCan you throw any light on the events of to-day?â€  â€œYes, sir.â€  â€œGo on.
Felix has hardly been my friend, but now that his cousin is away he may improve.
Well, Chester, I wish you every success.â€  â€œI am sure of that, Mr. Fairchild.
So the Sunday School paid more attention to James, whose prayers were beautiful.
Growing lads in the pit reduce their garments to shreds with amazing expedition.
This time he was sure: Dame Fortune would rise like Persephone out of the earth.
And her blue-grey eyes seemed to have become harder and greyer, lighter somehow.
Here was the old Alvina come back, rather battered and deteriorated, apparently.
Hence men were afraid of herâ€”of her power, once they had committed themselves.
â€œAlbert will look after it.â€  â€œThereâ€™s your chance,â€ said Arthur rudely.
â€œIâ€™m glad we still count for something, in spite of the greater attractions.
His plumbago-grey suit fitted exactlyâ€”save that it was perhaps a little tight.
â€œI should think so,â€ said Mr. May, a little disgusted even at the suggestion.
â€œHe takes possession on the first of October.â€  â€œWellâ€”itâ€™s a good idea.
â€œLet us hope he hasnâ€™t sold your father, thatâ€™s all,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Everywhere you went, these vermilion and black bars sprang from the wall at you.
But you know from the beginning it is going to endâ€”quite finallyâ€”quite soon.
The two _braves_ converse in dumb show, KishwÃ©gin swings the cradle and croons.
And the Natcha-Kee-Tawara Troupe was blowing like a rag of old paper into Limbo.
When Madame came downstairs Louis, who was a good satirical mimic, imitated him.
Mr. May returned, and said that Ciccio had ridden off down the Knarborough Road.
Madame effected the reunion of her troupe, and all seemed pretty much as before.
She had unlocked it before she went out, for that entrance was hardly ever used.
Without her, he would have felt too horribly uncomfortable on that raw hillside.
There, in that black town, thank heaven, she saw their announcement on the wall.
As she was busy washing a garment in the bowl, her landlady knocked and entered.
â€œThe stair is so dark.â€  He looked at her, and turned as if to get the light.
And yet she shrank from the long, inscrutable gaze of his black-set, tawny eyes.
Mrs. Rollings is coming in at four againâ€”â€  â€œOh all rightâ€”â€ said Alvina.
You know the Watsons are there.â€  â€œI believe youâ€™d be happy,â€ said Alvina.
â€œSee if there is any money.â€  He watched her steadily, and his brow darkened.
â€œAnd at a sufficient salary?â€  â€œQuite sufficient, thank you,â€ said Alvina.
â€œBut you mind being disturbed at your tea, I am sure.â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Max and Louis were Swiss, it would not affect them: nor Ciccio, who was Italian.
She avoided his love-making, by telling him any sort of spooniness revolted her.
Yes do!â€ She stretched out her long white arm to Alvina, with sudden imploring.
But Iâ€™ve only got black clothes, except uniforms.â€  â€œWell look here nowâ€”!
She kept it in her room till I came and took it.â€  â€œAll right,â€ said Alvina.
And Pancrazio lamented in his elegant English that no butter was to be obtained.

Mr. Conrad wrote:      â€œI have disposed of your two sketches to the same paper.

In his palmy days, James Houghton was _crÃªme de la crÃªme_ of Woodhouse society.
A year after the death of Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost became ill and suddenly died.
He is a perfect stranger to me.â€  And with this Alvina subtly contented herself.
It was most curious to see Miss Pinnegar turtle up at the mention of this scheme.
â€œItâ€™s absolutely ridiculous!â€ she repeated, unable to do more than splutter.
The Allsops were great Chapel people, and Cassie Allsop was one of the old maids.
Alvina really liked Arthur, and thought a good deal about himâ€”heaven knows why.
â€œYou donâ€™t mean to say youâ€™re nervous?â€ said Arthur rudely and sneeringly.
â€œThereâ€™s nothing against it, is there?â€  â€œOh, itâ€™s not that,â€ she said.
Perhaps neither of us was properly inclined.â€  â€œI should think so,â€ she said.
The hard white light showed her somewhat haggard-looking as she reached up to it.
He was even rather smart, judging from his yellow socks and yellow-and-brown tie.
It was with great difficulty he preserved his man-to-man openness and brightness.
James started as he nipped into the shop entrance, and found her confronting him.
The navvies were busy in troops along the Knarborough Road, and down Lumley Hill.
James now gave two performances each eveningâ€”and he always had _some_ audience.
â€œHave you eaten anything?â€  â€œOne little mouthful,â€ said Madame plaintively.
Louisâ€™ trousers were cut rather tight at the waist, and gave him a female look.
The girls opposite shrieked again, for all the world like a gang of grey baboons.
But there are other men besides these hereâ€”â€ She waved her hand to the window.
â€œBut I donâ€™t know what you call my nonsense.â€  â€œAh,â€ said Madame wearily.
Ciccio smiled slowly, the slow, fine, stupid smile, and turned to walk alongside.
â€œThereâ€™s nothing _else_, is there?â€  â€œWouldnâ€™t you stay on?â€ she asked.
â€œI donâ€™t believe any good will come of it.â€  â€œBut why?â€ persisted Alvina.
Then she said gravely:  â€œWell!â€”yes!â€”well!â€ She looked from one to another.
But Alvina was concerned only to flatter the plump, white, soft vanity of Madame.
Pacohuila, la musica!â€ cried Madame, starting to her feet and sounding frenzied.
Then, as she met his eyes,  â€œTo Woodhouse?â€ he said, watching her, to fix her.
â€œThen come on bicycle.â€  â€œYouâ€™re content to leave me,â€ muttered Geoffrey.
â€œSommes dâ€™accord.â€  â€œBen!â€ said Ciccio, holding out his hand for the bag.
Cette compagnie nâ€™est pas de ma choix.â€  â€œAllez!â€ said Ciccio, more loudly.
â€œYes, I do.â€  â€œWouldnâ€™t you rather wait, and seeâ€”â€  â€œWhat?â€ he said.
She would not be able to take the twelve-forty train, for it was already mid-day.
But thereâ€™s Sharps and Fullbanks to pay.â€  â€œIâ€™ll pay those,â€ said Alvina.
She smiled to herself when she saw his large and important presence on the board.
It was beautiful, and Alvina felt she had known it all before, in a happier life.
The fierce, savage gods who dipped their lips in blood, these were the true gods.
For had he not travelled Europe with English gentlemen, as a sort of model-valet!
She knew how he loved herâ€”almost inhumanly, elementally, without communication.
On sunny days Alvina walked down to the desolate river-bed, which fascinated her.
The moment she went through a door the sense of dark repulsiveness came over her.
It defines all the technical terms which it uses, and illustrates its principles.

Edgar Hazlitt.â€  â€œDo you know where Lexington Avenue is?â€ asked the professor.
He turned lazily as he heard the door open, and let his glance rest on Mr. Conrad.
â€œNo, he isnâ€™t.â€  â€œIâ€™ve come in about the monthâ€™s rent.â€  â€œVery well!
He had, besides, an idea that a boy so afflicted would be repulsive in appearance.
â€œDonâ€™t make too much of such a trifle, Chester!â€ returned the other, lightly.
Didnâ€™t you send this boy with a message?â€ said Mr. Perkins, rather impatiently.
Can you spare me?â€  â€œDoes your health require it, Mr. Rand?â€ asked the editor.
They looked at her, as if she were Woman itself, some creature not quite personal.
Itâ€™s a bronchial cold,â€ whispered Miss Frost hurriedly, trying to sip the milk.
But youâ€™ll feel other thingsâ€”â€  â€œI havenâ€™t the heart,â€ persisted Alvina.
Then stubbornly, he rigged them up again, and stared again at his interrupted job.
â€œIâ€™d rather have my own mistakes than somebody elseâ€™s rights,â€ said Alvina.
Wait a minute, Iâ€™ll see if we havenâ€™t got some of those pastilles for burning.
â€œWill you let me take your temperature?â€  Madame started and looked frightened.
But Ciccio, stretching forward taut and immobile with rage, was quite unconscious.
Madame, who was dancing KishwÃ©gin on the last evening, cast sharp glances at her.
â€œIs it finished?â€  â€œYes, I think.â€ He reached his pump and blew up the tire.
Only her large eyes looked blue in their tiredness, as she glanced down at Ciccio.
He studied her with alert, yellow-dusky, inscrutable eyes, until she met his look.
She looked at his frail, handsome, ethereal face, and crossed herself as she wept.
Uncouth, they seemed to him, all raw angles and harshness, like their own weather.
Itâ€™s enoughâ€”itâ€™s enoughâ€”â€  And there was a silence between the two women.
â€œTonight,â€ she said, â€œthe Natcha-Kee-Tawaras make their feast of affiliation.
â€œSeems yer doinâ€™ yersen a bit oâ€™ weshinâ€™.â€  Still Alvina didnâ€™t answer.
He was playing the wildly-yearning Neapolitan songs, of which Alvina knew nothing.
â€œArenâ€™t I comical?â€  She took him upstairsâ€”first to the monumental bedroom.
â€œAnd when are you going to let this fatal decision take effect?â€ asked Mr. May.
Luxuriously, she resented having to get up and tackle her heap of broken garments.
Is he a great hefty brute?â€  She looked with big, slow, enigmatic eyes at Alvina.
It was not her affair, where they should go, so long as he really returned to her.
Aristotle by this does not, as might seem, exclude rhythm and harmony from poetry.

Where are you goinâ€™ to work?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know yet,â€ answered Chester, sadly.
He had taken a severe cold from scanty clothing and exposure to the winter weather.

â€œI canâ€™t understand that you disliked Mr. Witham so much?â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œGo thou to Knarborough, Geoffrey, and seeâ€”and be back at the theatre for work.
Geoffrey passed on his bicycle, calling out that he would go straight to Woodhouse.
And then, flickering, wicked, doubtful, she watched Ciccio wrestling with the bear.
In the afternoon arrived Frederick Houghton, Jamesâ€™s cousin and nearest relative.
Yes!â€ And smiling, he kissed her, delicately, with a certain finesse of knowledge.
And they were all nettled, even indignant that she did not jump at their proposals.
Because we cannot say Miss Houghtonâ€”what?â€  â€œDo call me Alvina,â€ said Alvina.
â€œI donâ€™t like it.â€  â€œSummat a bit stronger â€™n â€™t bottle, my sakes alive!
They passed the ruins of Throttle-Haâ€™penny, and Alvina glanced at it indifferent.
â€œHow do I know!â€  â€œI should have thought it was obvious,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Miss Pinnegar glanced once at him, sullenly, and briefly answered his good-morning.
She snuggled deliciously in the sheets, and admitted to herself that she loved him.
â€œBut how positively awful,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, sinking motionless into a chair.
Alvinaâ€™s sphinx was an old, deep thoroughbred, she would take no mongrel answers.
Alvina suddenly reached forward and made a loud, screeching flourish on the hooter.
They had waited their turn and got insideâ€”Ciccio was not good at pushing his way.
But this meant another wild tussle with a Paris taxi-driver, in the filtering snow.

He turned like a quick-eared animal glancing up as she approached, but did not rise.
â€œHe died!â€ exclaimed the Italian, a flash of fear and dismay going over his face.
â€œSpeak then,â€ said Madame, â€œyou have a reason.â€ She seemed mistrustful of him.
She was too much upset, and she had almost a horror of seeing Ciccio at that moment.

For twenty years, she and James Houghton treated each other with a courteous distance.
CHAPTER II THE RISE OF ALVINA HOUGHTON   The heroine of this story is Alvina Houghton.
She remained for twenty years the demure, refined creature of her governessâ€™ desire.
â€œPersonally,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, speaking of Alexander, â€œI donâ€™t care for him.
He is nothing to me.â€  Miss Frost became gradually silent, and turned aside her face.
She sorted all her motherâ€™s clothesâ€”expensive, old-fashioned clothes, hardly worn.
For James Houghton had the impudence to make her an allowance of two shillings a week.
But I do mental science for my own interest.â€  Alvina had taken up a piece of sewing.
Everything was possible: and even desirable, once one could see the strangeness of it.
True enough, in Alvinaâ€™s pig-tail of soft brown the grey hairs were already showing.
Odd, extraneous creatures, often a little depressed, feeling life slip away from them.
He was fairly tall, but loosely built for an Italian, with slightly sloping shoulders.
There was a certain biting, annihilating quality in Louisâ€™ derision of the absentee.
Tell him that, the coward, that causes a womanâ€™s word to be broken against her will.
She turned round and took the door-handle, still holding his fingers in her left hand.
She remained there on the doorstep, neutral, blanched, with wide, still, neutral eyes.
â€œThe old oneâ€”the Missâ€”Miss Pinâ€”Pinnyâ€”what you call her.â€  â€œMiss Pinnegar!
â€œYouâ€™ll come again, wonâ€™t you?â€ She looked at him from her strained, pale face.
Madame made him a secret, imperative gesture that he should accompany the young woman.
Dash my rags, itâ€™s a caution!â€  â€œI havenâ€™t got five shillingsâ€”â€ said Alvina.
Shall I trust you thenâ€”?â€  Madame usually had a kitchen to herself, in the morning.
Quickly she opened the house-door and slipped inside, shutting it sharply in his face.
And he crept stealthily upstairs on tip-toe, a comical, flush-faced, tubby little man.
â€œWell,â€ he said, feeling with a finger-tip an imaginary roughness of one nail-edge.
Alvina preferred the labourers with their awful long moustaches that got full of food.
And if he says you are indispensableâ€”â€  This was a new idea for Alvina to cogitate.
He was just walking away with her down the road, clinging fast to her, enveloping her.
â€œIsnâ€™t this like Italy?â€  He looked darkly out of the window, and shook his head.
They all picked their way down into the great white-bouldered bed of a mountain river.
He took a long iron tube or blow-pipe, which rested on two little feet at the far end.
Nobody young can stop here.â€  The odd plangent certitude in his voice penetrated her.
The English middle ages, as has been shown, considered style synonymous with rhetoric.
Our zaptieh on his jaded horse faded away in the dim distance, and we saw him no more.
He was now making his way to Erivan, in Russia, on a sight-seeing tour from Trebizond.
After half an hourâ€™s rest, we prepared to decamp, and so did our Kurdish companions.
Our single bottle of tea had given out, and we suffered with thirst for several hours.
This proved advantageous on many occasions, and once, at Auli-eta, was even necessary.
Papers were given them to be signed by the succeeding authorities on our safe arrival.
We began to wade cautiously through with luggage and wheels balanced on our shoulders.

All boys smoke in the city.â€  â€œI donâ€™t think I should like it.â€  â€œOh, nonsense!
At the end of that time, how do you think I stood?â€  â€œHow?â€ asked Mullins, eagerly.
â€œSend him out!â€ suggested Dick, in a still lower tone, but Chester caught the words.
The expense was a consideration, and again he found it difficult to leave his business.
I certainly hope so.â€  â€œWhat shall you do about Ralston?â€ asked Chester, presently.
I suppose you have been there?â€  â€œNo; office boys donâ€™t often patronize Delmonico.
Over three thousand miles must be traversed by rail, but the trip is far from tiresome.

To one of her gossips Miss Pinnegar confessed:  â€œI thought sheâ€™d have felt it more.
â€œWould you mind holding the steps, so that they donâ€™t let me down again,â€ he said.
â€œYou seem somewhat quiet at Lumley,â€ he said, in his odd, refined-showmanâ€™s voice.
â€œI should think youâ€™ll never turn Alvina out on such a night,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Queer, dainty woman, was Madame, even to her wonderful threaded black-and-gold garters.
You are not bad looking, only a little too thinâ€”too haggardâ€”â€  She watched Alvina.
Her eyes had a bright, slightly-bewildered look as she turned from one face to another.
And now there is not much time.â€  â€œI am going to Woodhouse,â€ said Ciccio in French.
And nowâ€”â€  He went into certain technical matters, and Alvina signed some documents.
And when have we got to get out?â€  â€œOh, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a desperate hurry.
So that it was tiring work, which left her no time to herself, except just in snatches.
She smiled when she saw him at a sale, buying the grandest pieces of antique furniture.
â€œIâ€™ll wonder about you till Iâ€™ve made up my mindâ€”shall I?â€  â€œYes,â€ he said.
â€œNow I know you love me.â€ The pleased self-satisfaction in his voice made her angry.
â€œYou may congratulate Nurse Houghton and me on our engagementâ€”â€ He smiled largely.
Effie insisted on my coming to see you.â€  There was Ciccio climbing down with the bag.
Everywhere the hard-faced women came and stared into Alvinaâ€™s face, asking questions.
And even she, English housewife as she was, realized the futility of trying to wash it.
Alvina began to feel she would die, in the awful comfortless meaninglessness of it all.
When she was well enough they set off one early Monday morning to the market in Ossona.
Could Alvina bear to be so far off, when such terrible events were happening near home?

â€œBut Madame,â€ said Alvina, nettled, â€œI should never be half such a good business woman as you.
She became something quite different: fresh, virginal, pristine, a magic creature flickering there.
She turned, slipped past, ran indoors and upstairs to the little bare bedroom she had made her own.

He gave an odd, half-gay, half-mocking twitch of his thick dark brows, and began to laugh silently.

He could not understand why Felix Gordon, his cousin, had failed to impress Mr. Fairchild favorably.

At this moment a dignified-looking gentleman living on West Forty-seventh Street entered the office.
â€œYes; my name is Chester Rand.â€  â€œWhat!â€ exclaimed the brown-haired man, almost incredulously.

After the sale, however, James Houghton felt himself at liberty to plunge into an orgy of new stock.

Chester stopped short in dismay, and an expression of pain succeeded the gay look on Arthurâ€™s face.
Felix will take your place for the present.â€  â€œYes, Cousin David,â€ returned Felix, with alacrity.
â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€ asked Felix, in surprise, for he was quite unaware of Chesterâ€™s artistic gifts.

She stared for many hours at the light of the street-lamp, and there was a narrowed look in her eyes.
I donâ€™t mean anything by them.â€  â€œOh, as for that,â€ he said, taking the words out of her mouth.
Alvina fell again into humility and fear: she began to show symptoms of her motherâ€™s heart trouble.
Miss Poppy eyed him as if he were a cuckoo-clock, and she had to wait till heâ€™d finished cuckooing.
â€œWhy, Max, why didst thou not remain man enough to control that insulting mountain temper of thine.

Alvina had about a hundred pounds left from the insurance money, when all funeral expenses were paid.
â€œShe sat here for years, in this chair.â€  â€œAlways here?â€ he said, looking into Alvinaâ€™s face.
â€œIâ€™m putting my things into my two trunks, and I shall just ask Mrs. Slaney to store them for me.
Youâ€™re always knocked down.â€  â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter,â€ said Alvina, â€œif itâ€™s only in the end.
â€œWhy your barrow-load of cucumbers.â€  â€œOh,â€ said the man, scrutinizing his cucumbers carefully.
â€œWhen will they learn intelligence?â€ he said to Alvina, smiling and showing his white, even teeth.
â€œVery weak, please.â€  The doctor was a little laboured in his gallantry, but unmistakably gallant.
And my mind doesnâ€™tâ€”yet there it is!â€ She spread her fine hands with a flicker of inevitability.
But we want to be serenaded, donâ€™t we, nurse?â€”â€  Alvina stood at her window, but did not answer.
Then she took a little luggage, told the people of her house she would be back next day, and set off.
Her thoughts were dim, in the dim back regions of consciousnessâ€”yet, somewhere, she almost exulted.
A fat Italian hotel-keeper put on a smoking cap, covered the light, and spread himself before Alvina.

â€œYes, if I can make a living here.â€  â€œI guess cousin Herbert will help you.â€  â€œHe has already.
â€œBusiness is business, Mrs. Carlin.â€  â€œIf Mr. Fairchild were in, heâ€™d trate me better than you.
Now, my cousin whom I mentioned to you is quite at home all over the city.â€  â€œI am glad to hear it.
Shall I tell him how you found and gave me back the receipt?â€  â€œNo; let Mr. Mullins puzzle over it.
He ran up to him, seized his hand, kissed it, and said:  â€œI love you.â€  Arthur, too, looked amazed.
Before he knew what was going to happen, Chester received a light tap on the nose from his new friend.
When he entered the office, Mullins demanded, sharply, â€œWhat made you so long?â€  Chester explained.
â€œWhy, Chester!â€ exclaimed Mr. Perkins, cordially, as he rose and shook Chesterâ€™s hand vigorously.
You were kind to retain him.â€  Felix is really doing well, and bids fair to make a good business man.
James Houghton, however, was seized with a desire to work the Connection Meadow seam, as he called it.
Did ever you see such a pink face?â€  â€œ_And_ the braid binding!â€ said Miss Pinnegar in indignation.
James fluttered into conversation with his daughter the next evening, after Miss Pinnegar had retired.
â€œDonâ€™t you think,â€ he said to her, â€œitâ€™s an admirable scheme?â€  â€œWonderful,â€ she replied.
Alvina had to open the performance by playing an overture called â€œWelcome Allâ€: a ridiculous piece.
He was waiting now for the trams, and building up hopes since he could not build in bricks and mortar.
Ah, I think I must get up after all.â€  Alvina saw the look of fret and exhaustion in Madameâ€™s face.
â€œI must do as she tells me.â€  â€œWhy yes, since it is for your good, and not hers.â€  â€œOf course!
On Sunday the party would leave for Warsall, about thirty miles away, to fulfil their next engagement.
And then she saw Ciccio humped over his yellow bicycle, going for a steep and perilous ride with Gigi.
Alvina had noticed that Ciccio did not seem to feel the cold, unless it were a wind or a driving rain.
â€œYes,â€ he said, â€œit is always better if there is money.â€ He put his hand on her, and she winced.
She went down the corridor, away from him, to avoid this new agony, which after all was not her agony.
They were no sooner seated than a voice was heard, in beautifully-modulated English:  â€œYou are here!
And she wished she could lie down there by that town gate, in the sun, and swoon for ever unconscious.
As the characteristic quality of poetic, imitation to Aristotle evidently did not mean a literal copy.
If the young poet finds that his work is not of high excellence, he would do better not to publish it.
Thus far we have the influence of classical rhetoric urging as an ideal for poetry formal correctness.

â€œCanâ€™t we put it on?â€  â€œNo,â€ drawled Madame, â€œit was nothingâ€”just a non-sensical mood of the moment.
â€œWe had best go home and speak to Madame,â€ said Mr. May, who was very frightened for his evening performance.
â€œThis is just like him, to be soâ€”soâ€”â€ Madame could not express herself as she walked down to the kitchen.

I shall never have a heart to feel anything any more,â€ said Alvina, with a strange, distraught roll of the eyes.
Arthur Witham was also one of the Chapel menâ€”as had been his common, interfering, uneducated father before him.
â€œOf course heâ€™s not the man I should have imagined for you, butâ€”â€  â€œYou think heâ€™ll do?â€ said Alvina.

Tripp, it will give me pleasure if you will go out and take lunch with me.â€  â€œWell, I am sure youâ€™re very polite,â€ said Silas, pleased to think he would be saved expense; â€œIâ€™m much obliged.â€  So the two went out together.

Most Reverend Sir, whose Virtue did incite us, Whose Daughterâ€™s Charms did more invite us; We come to grace her with that Honour, That never Mortal yet had done her; Once only, _Jove_ was known in Story, To visit _Semele_ in Glory.
Say, Chester, old Tripp is rich, ainâ€™t he?â€  â€œI should call myself rich if I had his money.â€  â€œHeâ€™s a miserly old hunks, then, to give me such small pay.â€  â€œDonâ€™t let him hear you say so.â€  â€œIâ€™ll take care of that.
I may say that lots there are already worth twice what they were last week.â€  â€œHowâ€™s that?â€  â€œBecause work on the railroad has been resumed, and there is no doubt now that it will be pushed to completion.â€  â€œThat settles it.

Friendshipâ€™s too near a-kin to Love, _Pisaro_, To leave me any Peace, whilst in your Eyes I read Reserves, which â€˜tis not kind to hide; --Come, prithee tell me what the quarrel was, And who â€˜twas with; thou shalt, my dear _Pisaro_.
Probably his acquaintance with Ralston is recent, or he would have done something before this to insure his discharge.â€  There was a short silence, and Chester asked: â€œHave you any more questions, Mr. Sharpleigh?â€  â€œNot at present.
But the worst mixture, perhaps, was the â€œBairam soup,â€ which contains over a dozen ingredients, including peas, prunes, walnuts, cherries, dates, white and black beans, apricots, cracked wheat, raisins, etc.â€”all mixed in cold water.
I.    Celinda, _who did Love disdain,   For whom had languished many a Swain,   Leading her bleating Flocks to drink,   She spyâ€™d upon the Riverâ€™s brink   A Youth, whose Eyes did well declare   How much he lovâ€™d, but lovâ€™d not her_.

The lot adjoining your plot sold last week for two thousand dollars.â€  â€œTwo thousand?â€  â€œYes.â€  â€œProbably it would be well for me to wait a year or two, as the lots would undoubtedly command more then.â€  â€œThat is one way of looking at it.

Only when Miss Frost kissed Alvina good-bye at the station, tears came to her eyes, and she said hurriedly, in a low voice:  â€œRemember we are all praying for you, dear!â€  â€œNo, donâ€™t do that!â€ cried Alvina involuntarily, without knowing what she said.

A ballad on the Rye House Plot, entitled _The Conspiracy; or, The Discovery of the Fanatic Plot_, sings:--      Next valiant and noble Lord Howard,       That formerly dealt in lambâ€™s wool;     Who knowing what it is to be towered,       By impeaching may fill the jails full.
I, where Harman senior remarks at Towerson and Ysabindaâ€™s wedding: â€˜You Englishmen ... cannot stay for ceremonies; a good honest Dutchman would have been plying the glass all this while, and drunk to the hopes of Hans in Kelder till â€˜twas bedtime.â€™  p. 204 an _Apple John_.

â€œWell,â€ said David Mullins, addressing his cousin Felix, â€œdid you go to the Fifth Avenue Hotel last evening?â€  â€œYes, Cousin David.â€  â€œDid you see that man from Minneapolis and Chester?â€  â€œYes.â€  â€œWhere did they go?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t know?â€ frowned Mullins.
No Woman without Vizard in the Nation Can see it twice, and keep her reputation-- Thatâ€™s certain, Forgetting-- That he himself, in every gross Lampoon, Her leuder Secrets spread about the Town; Whilst their feignâ€™d Niceness is but cautious Fear, Their own Intrigues should be unravelâ€™d here.

Though this one Text were able to convert ye, Ye needy Tribe of Scriblers to the Party; Yet there are more advantages than these, For write, invent, and make what Plots you please, The wicked Party keep your Witnesses; Like frugal Cuckold-makers you beget Brats that securâ€™d by others fires shall sit.
Alcander_ is a worthy Youth and brave, I wish you would esteem him so; â€™.is true, thereâ€™s now some difference between us, Our Interests are disposâ€™d to several ways, But Time and Management will join us all: Iâ€™ll leave you; but prithee make it thy business To get my Pardon for last nightâ€™s rudeness.

This night Iâ€™m wiser grown by observation, My Love and Friendship taught me jealousy, Which like a cunning Spy brought in intelligence From every eye less wary than its own; They told me that the charming _Galatea_, In whom all power remains, Is yet too feeble to encounter Love; I find she has receivâ€™d the wanton God, Maugre my fond opinion of her Soul.
