And is it possible you can be tyâ€™d up to a Wife?
Pleasant this--Well, _Frank_, I do--And what then?
I say, let me no more see thee approach this Lady.
--But pray, how long, Sir, have you lovâ€™d me so?
Come, give me your Vows, or we must part for ever.
And you were so forward, Sir Timothy--  Sir _Tim_.
Why, Sir--what think you of debauching his Sister?
And you, _Frank_, will you marry my Niece _Diana_?
Well, and what do you intend to do, if it be, Sir?
_Enter_ Bellmour, _Sir_ Timothy, Sham _and_ Sharp.
Come hither, _Frank_, is not this a fine Creature?
--Nay, now--nor Heaven, nor Hell, shall hinder me.

Oh, Sir, youâ€™re welcome from _Northamptonshire_.
Hah--whoâ€™s that knocks--whoâ€™s there?--  _Bel_.
I wouâ€™d fain ask--a civil Question or two first.
Well, Sir, do you not know that I am married, Sir?
Give me your hand, my Love, my Life, my All--Alas!

Oh, tell me not of kindness, whereâ€™s _Alcippus_?
â€˜Tis much, my Lord, youâ€™ll not be satisfyâ€™d.
Nay, why shouldst thou delay me thus with stories?
Thou hast amazâ€™d me, prithee speak more clearly.

My Lord the Prince, what makes your Highness here?
--Where dost thou mean, bad Man, to hide thy head?
Why, Sir, do you think there can indeed be Ghosts?

Well, Sir, your business, for mine requires haste.
What arguments will you produce to prove You love?

Can you forgive the Griefs Iâ€™ve made you suffer?

CHESTERâ€™S FIRST EXPERIENCES IN NEW YORK     XII.
â€œI ainâ€™t rich,â€ said Silas Tripp, cautiously.
â€œYes, I had to part with my overcoat long since.
Silas Tripp has a small soul, hardly worth saving.
â€œI want everything to be legal,â€ resumed Bruce.
If you     have any others ready, send them along.
â€œYouâ€™ve got a tidy little place here, maâ€™am.
â€œI wonder where heâ€™s going,â€ thought Chester.
Donâ€™t you go for to run away.â€  Chester smiled.
â€œI say, thereâ€™s the tramp now,â€ he exclaimed.
â€œDoes Mr. James Long live here?â€ asked Chester.
He says that he left it behind in the office here.
â€œI think Iâ€™ll go to Dalyâ€™s Theater to-night.
He was shown at once into the professorâ€™s study.
â€œMay I come in, uncle?â€ he asked, with a smile.
Would you like to see him?â€  Chester shrank back.
â€œDid you come to see me?â€ asked Ernest, softly.
But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.
â€œWho are you?â€ asked the astonished bookkeeper.
â€œYes,â€ he answered, â€œhe arrived last evening.
Please call at     our office as soon as possible.
â€œI bring you an invitation to dinner,â€ he said.
â€œOnly a rich boy,â€ corrected Chester, laughing.
â€œAm I to arrest this man?â€ asked the policeman.
â€œThereâ€™s a great row at the office,â€ he said.
On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon.
Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant.
Will you go over with me to Mr. Taylorâ€™s office?
â€œGood-evening, Mr. Mullins,â€ he said, politely.
He had not been aware that his stepson could swim.
A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble.
â€œGood-eveninâ€™, widder,â€ said Silas, coughing.
Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.
Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.
In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.
She was not particularly religious by inclination.
It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.
She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.
She was as free of him as if he had never existed.
But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.
Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.
Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.
Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.
Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?
So both alike were defeated in their expectations.
For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.
Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.
There was no spontaneous interchange between them.
We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.
It all seemed really too funny to herâ€”too funny.
Whatâ€™s that for?â€ asked Lottie Witham shrewdly.
But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.
But it was Arthur who came out into communication.
â€œYou wonâ€™t _say_ you are,â€ interposed Arthur.
He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.
There isnâ€™t more than a minuteâ€™s fixing to do.
â€œItâ€™ll wash out,â€ he said, frightened of her.
What a man, answering her like a little automaton!
â€œI must go home.â€  â€œWhy, whatâ€™s your hurry!
Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.
And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.
Iâ€™m afraid he will have to do that part himself.
â€œMushroomsâ€”most beautiful things in the world.
The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.
The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.
This is the storm from whence the rainbow emerges.
For she did not find him at all physically moving.
Although you smile.â€  Alvina did more than smile.
I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.
And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.
Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.
Who would have thought KishwÃ©gin would need help.
â€œI donâ€™t think you can see at all,â€ she said.
She saw the light still burning in the front room.
â€œOhâ€”alorsâ€”Then I am better, I am quite well.
There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.
All alike!â€ Madame subsided fretfully and weakly.
The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.
But Mr. May was a little too frisky as KishwÃ©gin.
And now they think theyâ€™ve done it all, you see.
I shall go to Naples, to see my motherâ€™s sister.
A tidy man, _I_ say.â€  He did not look at Alvina.
You know theyâ€™re only men dressed up, for money.
Of course you wouldnâ€™t be a good business woman.
Mr. May enjoyed himself hugely playing KishwÃ©gin.
â€œLet us see.â€  Max now moved his arm with pain.
Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.
Ciccio!â€ he yelled, dropping off his own bicycle.
Wants thee to come back.â€  Ciccio shook his head.
Come with me, because I havenâ€™t all my strength.
â€œTe voilÃ  donc!â€ she said, without expression.
â€œSure,â€ he said slowly, with subtle intonation.
And I donâ€™t want to rob Natcha-Kee-Tawara, do I?
She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.
He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.
She looked back at him, as from across a distance.
And I warrant theyâ€™ll want to be at the funeral.
But all the time she was uttering her condolences.
It is not pleasant for you, who have not known it.
Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.
He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.
Ay, if she had her rights sheâ€™d be a rich woman.
Ay, when she thinks sheâ€™s hooked on to somebody.
She tried to think of Madameâ€™s slow enunciation.
â€œAll right,â€ he said, shaking her hand loosely.
â€œAll right,â€ he said, ducking and turning away.
And they all had schemes, and they all had advice.
Chiantiâ€”hein?â€  They all bowed above the table.
It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.
â€œI shall go and look at the town,â€ said Alvina.
And she knew they were relieved that she had gone.
â€œYou will come with me to Woodhouse?â€ she said.
Come on bicycle with me.â€  Ciccio shook his head.
There were other people in the carriage with them.
She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.
Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.
What a blow you give me!â€  â€œWhy?â€ said Alvina.
â€œOh!â€ perked Mr. May, yellow with strange rage.
â€œNow.â€  For a second, she struggled frenziedly.
â€œThat is only on the _estimate_ of the property.
For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.
She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.
â€œItâ€™s not more than I expected,â€ said Alvina.
Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.
â€œLet us wait, and see.â€  She took it smilingly.
So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.
And if not?â€  The two women looked at each other.
Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.
And she would be absolutely free, absolutely free.
The medical board were charming to herâ€”charming.
She could begin tomorrowâ€”but she had no uniform.
In the houses of the poor he was a great autocrat.
Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.
For this year of our story is the fatal year 1914.
And the next time I ask you, youâ€™ll let me know.
He enjoyed the procrastination as much as she did.
But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.
Perfectly horrible!â€  â€œWell,â€ said the matron.
Yet she was quite certain she would not marry him.
A child ran against the wheel of the standing car.
They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.
Then in the drive she picked up Effieâ€™s flowers.
I can understand a little Italianâ€”â€ She paused.
Ohâ€”!â€ She was wild and sweating with her pains.
But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.
He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.
Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.
Piace?â€  â€œDo you like it,â€ interpreted Ciccio.
Of course, I knew molto, from, music,â€ she added.
â€œHave you brought food?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Ciccio.
But thereâ€”a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.
And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.
This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.
Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.
I shall go to England.â€  He watched her narrowly.
â€œWhat is it?â€ she said, laying her hand on him.
â€œI canâ€™t come back.â€ She heard it so fatally.
She blew out the light, that she need not see him.
The Welsh shall treat us and ours in the same way.

Oh thou Monster of Ingratitude, have I caught thee?
But you must study to refine your Manners a little.
alas, my Lord, â€˜tis a silly Citizenâ€™s Daughter.
Dâ€™ye hear, hah?--this Lady has begâ€™d your life.
That you shall, Sir, Sol la me fa sol, &c.  _Fran_.
Come, come, we canâ€™t attend your amorous Parleys.
And how far is that from _Cadiz_?--but what care I?
Ay, Sir, to guard his Mistresses, â€˜tis an honour.

So may your change of Mistress do me, Sir--farewel.
Isâ€™t possible, Sir, you couâ€™d devise such News?
This is the most excellent revenge I ever heard of.
Ay, I learnt it of a great Politician of our Times.
So, put it into my Cabinet,--safe, _Francis_, safe.
Fortune and Love invite you, if you dare follow me.

It was Ketch who bungled the execution of Monmouth.
On the whole, things did not look very encouraging.
He was shocked by Silas Trippâ€™s want of humanity.
She looked up in surprise at her sonâ€™s companion.
â€œI donâ€™t think I care much for life,â€ he said.
You found the whisky here.â€  Ramsay made no reply.
I wonâ€™t get too much elated, for it may not last.
â€œI will go up to Mr. Conradâ€™s room,â€ said Rob.
â€œNow,â€ he said, â€œI had better do the ordering.
â€œI know of Prof. Hazlitt, though I never met him.
I think heâ€™ll be able to go to work by Wednesday.
â€œWhoâ€™s that boy?â€ he inquired, in a low voice.
You will find pencils and drawing paper before you.
It was easy to see that it was a boyâ€™s apartment.
Chester decided to say nothing, but to be watchful.
â€œI hear you want to see me,â€ he said to Mullins.
The city I represent is a smart one and no mistake.
What will you do?â€  â€œI have some money saved up.
With twenty-five dollars a week he would feel rich.
This question will be answered in the next chapter.
It was not often that Silas Tripp went to New York.
He saw that the bait was likely to prove effective.
â€œOh, you mean the real estate office,â€ she said.
He was getting on fast with the professorâ€™s work.
â€œI will bear in mind what you say,â€ he answered.
When did Mr. Fairchild return?â€  â€œThis forenoon.
Make careful inquiries as to the value of property.
I donâ€™t think a man of your age would deceive me.
â€œOf course I brought him here,â€ growled Trimble.
Her father tended to a supercilious, sneering tone.
It was curiosity, deep, radical, burning curiosity.
â€œBut where do you want to go?â€ asked Miss Frost.
Miss Frostâ€™s right hand beat like a wounded bird.
â€œThen we must think about it,â€ she said, numbly.
But the new and recalcitrant Vina still shone hard.
â€œThank you,â€ said Alvina, and the girl departed.
But what did the woman, the sufferer, herself care!
Her day was not their day, their life was not hers.
What ought James Houghton to have done differently?
It requires a second party to come to an agreement.
He would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever.
For, of course, he had a sort of fame in Woodhouse.
But moved or touched?â€”not the least in the world.
He kept his customers chatting as long as he could.
It is more or less the story of thousands of girls.
Wherever he was, his wife was a hundred miles away.
And he found it a damn god-forsaken hell of a hole.
Getting on all right?â€  â€œFair,â€ said the woman.
When would he be able to get an advance from James?
I couldnâ€™t think of it.â€  â€œThen name a figure.
He wrote various letters and drew up certain notes.
The shop isnâ€™t worth while,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Itâ€™s a mercy Miss Frost and your mother are dead.
Well, all I can say, Iâ€™m glad I am not concerned.
He was terribly secretive with respect to business.
I know we are.â€  Mr. May looked down in the mouth.
You couldnâ€™t get excited about it: not as a rule.
The trams, moreover, would begin to run in January.
â€œThese are my family of young men,â€ said Madame.
Que ferez-vous, mes pauvres, sans votre KishwÃ©gin.
Alvina hurried indoors, and the young man followed.
What a white-skinned, soft, plump child she seemed!
Alvina practised the music Madame carried with her.
â€œYes, youâ€™re wonderful,â€ said Alvina, choking.
Yet she felt convinced of his ultimate good-nature.
They _were_ unreal, Madame and Ciccio and the rest.
Helpless, inert she lay, in her orgasm of laughter.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras all sat with straight faces.
Then what future have you?â€ said Mr. May gloomily.
Ah, this Woodhouse, a curse is on it, I know it is.
It was so, and Geoffrey was philosophical about it.
Then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction.
You must never let them think you have caught them.
Still she smiled at him, and still he gave no sign.
But she could not make out what his watching meant.
She was the clue to all the action, was KishwÃ©gin.
He was a little bit repellent and brutal, inverted.
She loved them so much, she wanted to be with them.
He could not interrupt Alvina, nor the performance.
â€œFather,â€ she said, shaking his shoulder gently.
â€œCan you manage?â€ cried Alvina, showing a light.
Mr. May came in, and stayed for a dismal half-hour.
â€œI should like him to come,â€ said Alvina simply.
And if he will still have you, then you must think.
â€œYou return to the funeral?â€ said Madame coldly.
â€œBuy Miss Houghton outâ€”â€ said Madame shrewdly.
He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood.
Everything heâ€™s gotâ€™s mortgaged up to the hilt.
Alvina broke away from her cousin, and went to him.
â€œTell me what _you_ think,â€ she said repeatedly.
Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.
â€œAnd how is everything at Woodhouse?â€ she asked.
So I collected all the money I could, and ran away.
And after all, Woodhouse wasnâ€™t fifty miles away.
The young men had been out shopping for the supper.
Viale, it is Italian for the little way, the alley.
Yes?â€ she added, with her subtle, malicious smile.
And so the tea-time passed, and the time after tea.
â€œPlease donâ€™t get up,â€ she said to the others.
â€œI donâ€™t want to stay here, anyhow,â€ she said.
And a good many things are a bad job, besides that.
Pas pour moi!â€  And they went laughing downstairs.
But Iâ€™m afraid we shall have a rather _dry_ game?
â€œI shall sell out of the Endeavour.â€  â€œReally!
â€œAnd have you told Miss Pinnegar?â€ said Mr. May.
Alvina looked at Ciccio, who stood above, watching.
And quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire.
The men went out to attend to Geoffreyâ€™s bicycle.
You might come to the lawyerâ€™s with me, will you?
â€œYouâ€™ll be there at seven oâ€™clock?â€ he said.
â€œBut youâ€™re all right, yourself, Miss Pinnegar.
Itâ€™s all shown in my books,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
The cordiality, the _joie de vivre_ did not revive.
â€œTo look at the papers and magazines.â€  â€œHa-a!
She had wired to Madame, she had wired for her box.
Every one is most kind, and I feel at home already.
â€œFower per cent.,â€ mimicked the doctor brutally.
And I know that those things cause me half my work.
â€œOh yes, I intend to,â€ he said, with confidence.
But wondering about the Natchas would not help her.
She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.
His face was blind with anger, like a hot, red sun.
And both of us, since we are now one,â€ he replied.
â€œYou know that.â€  She had to go to tea with him.
Next month, at the latest.â€  â€œOh no,â€ she said.
â€œMy flesh isnâ€™t concerned, and my mind isnâ€™t.
â€œOh, the flesh is a _beastly_ thing!â€ she cried.
But she found Ciccio leaning against a gate-pillar.
Itâ€™s horribleâ€”â€  â€œWell, itâ€™s not my fault.
Come with me, Allaye.â€  She could not look at him.
The faÃ§ade of a church rose from a small eminence.
In the rear was Giovanni, making noises at the ass.
Pancrazio went back over the stream with the light.
Ciccio watched her as she quickly brushed her hair.
Truly, she had to support the souls of the two men.
She was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself.
But her chest was raw, she felt weak and miserable.
Ciccio and Pancrazio and Alvina went quietly about.
Ciccio too was feasted, in the dark hole of a room.
The old crone said something unintelligible to her.
She sank on her knees on a sheaf of corn-marigolds.
She put down the spoon and looked up from the fire.

At times other, honey scents wafted from the hills.

an excellent physician.â€™    THE FORCâ€™D MARRIAGE.
The traverse was merely a pair of curtains on a rod.
â€œIâ€™ll go out and take a walk, mother,â€ he said.
In twenty minutes he handed the paper to Mr. Conrad.
â€œGood-night, and good luck to you!â€ said Chester.
â€œWhere did you find him, Mr. Perkins?â€ asked Rev.
The remaining space was left for the outside public.
He went up to the table where the broker was seated.
They walked over to Broadway, chatting as they went.
He held the card in his hand, and was looking at it.
As for me, I donâ€™t have the appetite I do at home.
Did you enjoy the play, Felix?â€  â€œYes, thank you.
I expect to live to see fifty thousand people there.
There is nothing to do but to carry out our program.
â€œThen it was not all put in one parcel?â€ he said.
â€œNow you see how I am making my living,â€ he said.
â€œNow,â€ said Edward, â€œI must try to get a place.
I mean in a week or two to come home to pass Sunday.
The picture drawn by Mr. Floyd was too much for her.
It donâ€™t take long for fifty dollars to melt away.
Every one wanted it, including the girls themselves.
But that peeled and quartered apple was her portion.
They stood outside and pointed, giggled, and jeered.
Then he flitted back at half-past twelve, to dinner.
She had to let James run the gamut of his creations.
The new entertainment was the Friday-nightâ€™s sale.
This was coming down in the world, with a vengeance.
In fact, all things considered, he was about square.
First the Board of Trade began to make difficulties.
Fordham being in some way connected with his mother.
There she had to go, right off, and help with cases.
There she had to attend lectures and demonstrations.
She had to confess that she liked the young doctors.
She bounced back into Woodhouse to make her fortune.
But Miss Frost sat by the dead in grief and despair.
Lottie Witham eyed the thin, nervous face of Alvina.
Her life was utterly barren now Miss Frost had gone.
And what she wanted was something serious and risky.
The shop was opened once a week, on Friday evenings.
â€œIt may well take your breath away,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou find it so, do you!â€ returned Miss Pinnegar.
He could not bear the sudden acute hurt to his shin.
â€œIt would be all the same if I did,â€ said Alvina.
â€œItâ€™s no more easy to understand,â€ said Alvina.
It just kills them off or throws them disused aside.
He had been in America, out West, doing shows there.
How wonderfully the satin of his waistcoat had worn!
And the two men came to no agreement _that_ morning.
And the address, please?â€  â€œI dunno thâ€™ street.
â€œI believe he has,â€ said Miss Pinnegar pensively.
I like a little yellow turnip,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
But itâ€™s so different with the mental friendships.
And _then_â€”she nearly set the stools on top of me.
â€œI canâ€™t believe they want nothing but pictures.
For after all, she got a good deal of fun out of it.
Odd, eccentric people they were, these entertainers.
â€œIâ€™ll run round for the doctorâ€”â€ said Alvina.
Best leave me.â€  â€œLet me help you,â€ said Alvina.
â€œWonâ€™t you all go downstairs now?â€ said Alvina.
The prisoner is tripped upâ€”falls, and cannot rise.
Thought it out, you mean?â€  â€œThought it out, yes.
Her impulse was to turn and go away from the stable.
I _couldnâ€™t_.â€  Madame nodded slowly up and down.
â€œEnglishwomen,â€ said Madame, â€œare so practical.
Suddenly Louis started and held up a warning finger.
â€œI begin to wonder if I have mistaken my vocation.
They want it all through the eye, and finishedâ€”so!
But Ciccio it put into unholy, ungovernable tempers.
â€œThese Italians,â€ said Louis, turning to Mr. May.
Geoffrey smiled sheepishly, and his colour deepened.
The young men were moving about making preparations.
The moccasin was a little too shortâ€”just a little.
â€œIâ€™m awfully sorry you are going,â€ said Alvina.
He brought them before.â€  â€œBut I will carry them.
â€œDo you want?â€ he said, as if waiting for orders.
Even Ciccio she regarded as only one of the Natchas.
She forgot the question in others that occupied her.
â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ he said, in a brittle fashion.
â€œFatherâ€™s ill!â€ she announced to Miss Pinnegar.
Worn out!â€ Madame said, nodding slowly up and down.
You are his property, when you marry by Italian law.
Madame turned to look at the unhappy, elderly woman.
And then she had the satisfaction of sizing them up.
Oh yes, why he fair seemed to totter down to Lumley.
Look, thereâ€™s room for Alvinaâ€™s name underneath.
Well, after all, it had been a home and a home life.
Wonâ€™t you ask Ciccio to drive with you in the cab?
Quickly she put forward her hand to protect herself.
She entered, and he followed, flashing on the light.
And she turned her face to the wall, feeling beaten.
She really expected him now to come to speak to her.
â€œCanâ€™t I do anything else for you?â€  â€œFor me?
Madame gave Alvina a fine awl and some waxed thread.
But run, run!â€  And Madame really stamped her foot.
â€œI have my key and can see quite well,â€ she said.
But obstinately he lounged into the street with her.
Within a hairâ€™s-breadth she had let him disappear.
â€œCan I come to Woodhouse?â€  â€œWhen?â€  â€œToday.
Helplessly she put her hand across the table to him.
So she had to be knocked up, for she was lying down.
He spread his hands, deprecating, not understanding.
â€œYesâ€”eh?â€ His eyes gleamed on her for a moment.
It drove him to make a show of himself to the world.
Geoffrey arrived, his broad face hot and perspiring.
Isnâ€™t that your opinion?â€  The other men laughed.
What, isnâ€™t it so?â€  â€œOf course,â€ said Alvina.
Ciccio stood with his hands on the table, listening.
Iâ€™ve made breakfast for years, now,â€ said Alvina.
At ten oâ€™clock she was to go to the family lawyer.
Wellâ€”it might have been worse.â€  Again he waited.
They had regard for her possibilities as an heiress.
â€œIâ€™m going to keep the insurance money, any way.
Never had Ciccioâ€™s brow looked so ominously black.
And thenâ€”the unknown vengeance of the authorities.
And Alvina came in with the rest: she paid no board.
â€œWhy are you going to the library?â€ he asked her.
She could be quite happy by herself among the lakes.
Iâ€™d rather have him than your smarmy slormin sort.
Dr. Mitchell pointed to the green pile of cucumbers.
â€œMay I come in?â€ His voice sounded almost flirty.
â€œWhat do you think of this new war?â€ said Alvina.
She was very much excited, very much excited indeed.
There was nothing at all against it: nothing at all.
Who was this elderly man, that she should marry him?
Certainly her shoulder hurt where he had gripped it.
And they met the matron just coming out of the ward.
And he drew up a plan of a wedding tour in Scotland.
They did not meet a great deal outside the hospital.
â€œDo play again!â€ Mrs. Tuke called into the night.
â€œPut me down, Ciccio.â€  â€œCome with me to Italy.
â€œDo ask him to come up for a minute,â€ Effie said.
Mrs. Tuke had a baby daughter, and was getting well.
She wondered if he had a right to be angry with her.
You donâ€™t want to marry a man you canâ€™t talk to.
â€œI havenâ€™t brought him,â€ he said, watching her.
Dark and insidious he was: he had no regard for her.
Ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage.
She quivered, as if it was more than she could bear.
The sea heaved with a sucking noise inside the dock.
Then came the first cry one ever hears: â€œ_Porteur!
They expected Pancrazio to meet them at the station.
Words of American sounded among the Italian dialect.
Ciccio picked up the bread and put it under his arm.
But he wonâ€™t go except where he thinks he will go.
â€œI told them to make a fire and prepare the house.
He seemed to do everything, old, stooping as he was.
They were all very kind to her, as far as they knew.
They all tried it once, but they would not go again.
Approaching it were rows of low cabinsâ€”fairly new.
She went inside, and was almost sick with repulsion.
She sank lower on the flowers, and her head dropped.
She would do anything rather than be really crushed.
And it revealed itself in his fear of his dead wife.
Thus the literature of the silver-age is rhetorical.
Poetry cannot lie because it never pretends to fact.
His reason for favoring the third view is important.
For him allegory involved distortion and perversion.
The poet presents truth under the guise of allegory.
The instrument of poetry was the rhetorical example.
If either are taken literally, they will seem false.
It truly makes a world nearer to our heart's desire.

We were alone, however, and that was rest in itself.
This tenting was all of a dark brown or black color.
Explanations were made, and the camels soon quieted.
For this, however, there is a very plausible excuse.
All these movements we photographed with our camera.
But, nothing daunted, they would pass round the hat.
â€œWill you run for any political office in America?
Again--tell me, what answer, Rascal, did she send me?
Come hither, Boy-- And said the Lady nothing to thee?
--Why, since you could not love me, did you marry me?
No, but that thou shouldâ€™st hide it all this while.
Doubtless her Reasons must be great for this Request.

Why, thy Cuckold that shall be, if thou beâ€™st wise.
Hangâ€™d, Sir, hangâ€™d--at the _Hague_ in _Holland_.
Sure, there can be nothing worth a Manâ€™s Curiosity?
That was the Wonder, Sir, because â€˜twas impossible.
I scorn your Words, Sir--is this a place to trust in?
thatâ€™s a good one, iâ€™faith: shall you rule, or I?

_Enter Sir_ Cautious, Bearjest, Noisey _and_ Bredwel.
Yes, Madam, I shall tell him--      _Enter _Bellmour.
But I shall improve â€˜em, Madam, Iâ€™ll warrant you.
Oh--why do I shake?--sure Iâ€™m a Man, what art thou?
So, the Fools are going, and now to _Juliaâ€™s_ Arms.
Unhand me, false Deceiver--let me loose--  Sir _Cau_.

There are innumerable contemporary references to him.
There is more than one reference to them in MoliÃ¨re.
I might do something with them.â€  â€œThank you, sir.
â€œThree hundred and fifty dollars!â€ she ejaculated.
â€œYou look strong and healthy,â€ observed Mrs. Rand.
It was some minutes after ten when he left the house.
Now the opportunity had come, but could he accept it?
I am glad to see you and hope you will like the city.
He felt that it was important for him to do his best.
She was the nurse, who had constant charge of Ernest.
â€œNo, I want to stay with him,â€ indicating Chester.
You only wanted to get rid of the kid.â€  â€œExactly.
â€œI always did like Western people.â€  â€œThank you.
â€œYes, sir.â€  â€œI can tell you something about it.
â€œI think he is pretty well off,â€ answered Chester.
It would make it easier for him to discharge Chester.
I donâ€™t care for the age of any of my contributors.
â€œI guess Iâ€™ll go and see Chester Rand,â€ he said.
So he got up a false charge against me of dishonesty.
It may have fallen into the hands of your stepfather.
â€œIt may be because she doesnâ€™t know your address.
I am an old friend, and have a right to remember you.
â€œI have found a place for you,â€ he said, brightly.
About this period he received a letter from Wyncombe.
When do you want to start?â€  â€œAs soon as possible.
You may take the wrong cars.â€  Again Chester smiled.
Abner Trimble turned pale and uttered an imprecation.
Houghtonâ€™s Great Bargain Events were really events.
After some years of hanging on, he let go splendidly.
As James went further into life, he became a dreamer.
She had fully decided never to leave her two charges.
â€œSheâ€™s a lady if ever there was one,â€ they said.
The people did not like her, yet she influenced them.
And yet he felt Klondyke as the greatest blow of all.
But it was Throttle-Haâ€™penny that made him tremble.
Perhaps her fatherâ€™s beautiful prayers put her off.
The sardonic quality was, however, quite in abeyance.
For some days she went about happily, in pure relief.
I simply canâ€™t bear it, and thereâ€™s an end of it.
It was so characteristic, that Alvina almost laughed.
She believed that Alvina was just speaking at random.
She put it down on the drab-painted chest of drawers.
But her backbone became only the stronger and firmer.
But she never for one moment reflected on the advice.
Manchester House had settled down on her like a doom.
And so it was during these months nursing her mother.
The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled.
Become a nameless nobody, occupying obscure premises?
Miss Pinnegar watched him with a sort of sullen fury.
â€œOh well, so be it,â€ said her spirit vindictively.
â€œGood morning, Miss Houghton,â€ said Arthur Witham.
â€œIâ€™ll see,â€ she answered, and she left the shop.
I wouldnâ€™t sleep in _that_ for a trifle, by myself!
Arthur was short and dark-haired and nicely coloured.
â€œIt is bad,â€ he said furious because of the shock.
She got his handkerchief and wiped her fingers on it.
â€œItâ€™s got to be done, Sunday tomorrow,â€ he said.
Look here!â€ She showed the bloodstains on her dress.
There was something aggressive and vulgar about them.
There have been enough stories about ordinary people.
â€œI missed a chance there,â€ said James, fluttering.
Very interesting I find itâ€”very interesting indeed.
â€œOne!â€ he said officially, pushing out the ticket.
Time came, and the colliers began to drum their feet.
â€œI donâ€™t believe they like the turns,â€ she said.
She was getting so tired of Mr. Mayâ€™s quiet prance.
She was supposed to be â€œcarrying onâ€ with Mr. May.
Queer cuts these!â€”but just a little bit beyond her.
Usually she spoke in French only, with her young men.
She spoke an appropriate good-night, to each of them.
He still shook dissent, but opened his mouth at last.
Then he straightened himself again, and turned aside.
He perked up his head in an odd, parrot-like fashion.
In the dressing-room, the dividing-curtain was drawn.
It was his instinct to say at once he would take her.
â€œYouâ€™ve seen nothingâ€”nothing,â€ he said to her.
You donâ€™t know anything by looking at these people.
That is very nice also.â€  â€œYes,â€ replied Mr. May.
â€œBut why is it?â€ said Mr. May, angry and petulant.
Thud went the boards again, with the spring of a man.
Too much, too much of an animal, too little _esprit_.
Max, thou dost not want to part, brother, well-loved?
And if thou canâ€™st find him, bring him again to us.
He knew Ciccio was dissatisfied, and wanted a change.
Again the two women waited wearily at the street-end.
Neither faith nor feeling, neither faith nor feeling.
His skin was delicately tawny, and slightly lustrous.
â€œBut I donâ€™t like to take _these_,â€ said Alvina.
Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking.
It was far more like pain, like agony, than like joy.
Alvina felt a burning inside her, thinking of Ciccio.
He will go out to somewhere.â€  Alvina looked at him.
Or he will draw you down, downâ€”Yes, one or another.
But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them.
Offers of charity were innumerableâ€”for three weeks.
So much money is certain, perhaps there will be more.
Ciccio was on Alvinaâ€™s right hand: a delicate hint.
And she half expected Ciccio to come to speak to her.
â€œNow what you want you must ask me for,â€ she said.
â€œDo have it since you like it.â€  â€œOh, I canâ€™t!
However, there was time for her to retrace her steps.
â€œReally, eh?â€ he said, holding out his large hand.
Alvina strolled away towards the half-open bookstall.
Alvina went to her and laid her hand on her shoulder.
â€œFine pianoâ€”eh?â€ he said, looking into her face.
â€œI donâ€™t mind, really, if I can live,â€ she said.
You havenâ€™t a small travelling case, Miss Houghton?
I love thee as a brother, my Ciccio, as thou knowest.
Then she washed up, removing all traces of the feast.
Mrs. Rollings would not appear till later in the day.
You will be here a few days?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
May I ask where your company is performing this week?
Mercifully, for the mere moment, she was independent.
â€œYouâ€™ve heard?â€ said Miss Pinnegar dramatically.
â€œThatâ€™s â€™appen for them as doesnâ€™t like them.
This was another matter, apart from her Dr. Mitchell.
The matron softly closed the door again, withdrawing.
And then you need be surprised at nothing, _nothing_.
And into the bargain she was a personality, a person.
Apart from Dr. Mitchell she had a magic potentiality.
Yes do!â€ Mrs. Tukeâ€™s eyes were arched and excited.
Why shouldnâ€™t one human being go away from another?
â€œWeâ€™ll give him a glass of Tommyâ€™s famous port.
You should have faith in life.â€  â€œBut I hate life.
It was such a long time since she had thought of him.
You come with me.â€  â€œHa!â€ she sniffed scornfully.
She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow.
She caught Ciccioâ€™s arm, as the boat rolled gently.
But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky.
Adieu!â€ cried Gigi, clutching the other manâ€™s arm.
It had been dark a long time when they reached Turin.
Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them.
But it isnâ€™t the place for young people to live in.
â€œDonâ€™t you think itâ€™s fun?â€ she said, smiling.
The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment.
â€œI believe Iâ€™m going to have a child,â€ she said.
There was nothing for her but to yield, yield, yield.
It all seemed alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.
But it was a fear of the elements rather than of man.
Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian.
It was a sort of worship, almost a degradation again.
A shiver of horror and death went through the valley.
If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.
He hath bene knowne by his coate this thirtie Winter.
For they both invent,   fame, and devise many things.
But his ideas are based upon a very different theory.
Though less picturesque, it was incomparably grander.
The assembled rabble raised a lusty cheer at parting.
The seat of honor is always the one next to the wall.
Do you expect to get back all or more than you spent?
Come, follow me then, and you shall be both pleasâ€™d.
A dainty Boy--thereâ€™s Money for to buy thee Nickers.

Sir, I think we were best to marry her out of the way.
Sir, â€˜twas Parson _Tickletext_ that marryâ€™d â€˜em.
How fain sheâ€™d have me gone now; ah, subtle Serpent!
Lord, and you be so froward, Iâ€™ll be gone.--  _Car_.
--Old Fellow,--prithee what Person of Quality is that?
Oh, dear Captain, let us tack about and go home again.
Slaves, no Sir, weâ€™re Slaves to none but the Ladies.
A good Cudgelling, anâ€™t please your Illustriousness.
Why, youâ€™re a _Mahometan_ Bitch, and you go to that.
Come hither, Slave,--why, was it that I gave you Life?
Why, what a Pox, is not this the Great _Turk_ himself?
This is the Course youâ€™d have me steer, I thank you.
What a leud Description hast thou made of his Chamber?
Oh, â€˜tis too late for business--let to morrow serve.
I grant it, Sir--but to the business, Sir, I came for.
Bredwel _sees them,     and puts_ Gayman_ back again_.
And Sir _Feeble_, the Devilâ€™s inâ€™t if he know him.
Ay, but he could never do it fairly, thatâ€™s certain.
Youâ€™ve both offended Heaven, and must repent or die.
Nay, and she be thereabouts, thereâ€™s no discovering.
_Enter_ Alcippus _and_ Erminia, _as in a Bed-Chamber_.

No more, Is this your duty to your Prince, _Alcander_?
Hold, dear _Cleontius_, hold, and Iâ€™ll do any thing.
No, give me your hand, and prove mine flesh and blood.
The farce was repeated on 25 October of the same year.
I am of that opinion, Sir; Man was not made for Woman.
But have you never servâ€™d Countesses and Dutchesses?
Sheâ€™s taking aim, she cannot chuse but like me best.
Hold, hold, Iâ€™ll confess all, rather than indure it.
I have brought you off, manage him as well as you can.

â€œWhen one business suspends it affects all the rest.
â€œYou asked me where you could find a bed,â€ he said.
He has no money.â€  â€œNo, I ainâ€™t,â€ snarled Silas.
If your bequest amounts to anything I will not object.
â€œDid my nephew leave any money?â€ he asked, sharply.
â€œTwenty minutes.â€  â€œAnd you received ten dollars.
Chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard.
Mullinsâ€”been in this office?â€  â€œAbout five years.
A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.
â€œYou did not forget your appointment.â€  â€œNo, sir.
â€œThat is my poor, little cousin,â€ explained Arthur.
He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.
Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.
If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?
There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.
Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.
Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.
He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.
â€œAssuredly, my dear sir,â€ said Gripp, with suavity.
Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.
â€œIs that Mr. Fairchildâ€™s office?â€ inquired Silas.
â€œWas this package given you at the bank?â€ he asked.
â€œDid Mr. Mullins say where he was going?â€ he asked.
I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.
â€œDonâ€™t you remember me, Mr. Wilson?â€ said Edward.
â€œWill your son be able to pay this?â€ asked Chester.
â€œI had a few dollars saved, and went to Minneapolis.
He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.
But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.
A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.
Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.
Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.
James hovered round and said the last word, of course.
He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.
The man was always running in when Miss Frost was out.
He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.
Thereâ€™s a great risk in going so farâ€”a great risk.
The food was objectionableâ€”yet Alvina got fat on it.
It is but one side of the medalâ€”the crowned reverse.
Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.
Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.
She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.
Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.
And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.
â€œNonsense, child!â€ expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.
Will you explain why!â€ retorted James, turtling also.
â€œAnd father has no money, Iâ€™m sure,â€ said Alvina.
It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Withamâ€™s part.
He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.
There was one who was climbing out, to be a gentleman.
The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.
â€œAre they for me?â€ she said, with false brightness.
I believe heâ€™s a despicable character,â€ said James.
You ought not to want all your children to feel alike.
Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.
After this she really did what she could to avoid him.
â€œThe bone isnâ€™t broken,â€ she said professionally.
Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.
But she could not sewâ€”and she could not settle down.
But all the time, what was there actually in her life?
She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.
Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.
So again he walked down to Lumley to post his letters.
Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.
But James was in one of his abstractions, his trances.
He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.
And in a while she began to eat, as if she were alone.
Not another word about the cinema: not another breath.
As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.
Which is all I have to say,â€ announced Miss Pinnegar.
After all, your fatherâ€™s affairs donâ€™t concern me.
But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.
â€œGoodness!â€ she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.
Physically he was not there: he was oddly an absentee.
The Endeavour was successfulâ€”yes, it was successful.
The four young men were four nice civil young fellows.
â€œIâ€™ll go to bed,â€ said Madame, obediently rising.
Ach, oh jeh, oh jeh!â€  â€œAch nein, Madame, ach nein.
â€œGood-night, my faithful Max, I trust myself to you.
Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.
It is too dre-eadful, too dre-eadful!â€ wailed Madame.
What does Madame _do_?â€ she asked a little jealously.
But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.
He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.
Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.
They took off his waistcoat and pushed back his shirt.
â€œIf the bone isnâ€™t broken!â€ said Louis anxiously.
Please!â€  â€œWhat?â€ said Madame, eyeing her closely.
â€œYes,â€ he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.
She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.
She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.
â€œOh yes!â€ she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.
â€œBut you canâ€™t help it, away there from everybody.
It is all of it true,â€ whispered Madame vindictively.
When he got into the hall he laid his hand on his hat.
â€œThis is polite behaviour!â€ she said sarcastically.
But Iâ€™ve been here many years,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
And sheâ€™s got no relations to go to either, has she?
Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.
But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.
I shall see.â€ Till one and all became angry with her.
â€œAt the station!â€ exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.
It was my great-grandmotherâ€™s.â€  â€œDo you mean it?
Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.
After all, she had been bred up differently from that.
â€œIâ€™ve had ham and eggs before.â€  â€œYou do, hein?
She clung to Ciccioâ€™s dark, despised foreign nature.
â€œWe must have supper.â€  It was past nine oâ€™clock.
Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.
Upon my word!â€  â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ said Alvina.
â€œGood-morning!â€ she said, and went on with her tea.
â€œBut you can have love without marriage,â€ she said.
She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.
There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.
She ought to take the twelve-forty train to Mansfield.
She knew she would be much cheaper in Madameâ€™s eyes.
â€œYou tell Atterwell what to put on fatherâ€™s stone.
It must have been a detectiveâ€”some shoddy detective.
She insisted on Miss Pinnegarâ€™s having half of this.
Isnâ€™t it so?â€  â€œPerhaps it is,â€ admitted Alvina.
Gradually Dr. Mitchellâ€™s manner changed towards her.
As they drove he saw a man with a barrow of cucumbers.
â€œI didnâ€™t intend to disturb you, nurse,â€ he said.
But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.
â€œI think to Windermereâ€”into the Lakes,â€ she said.
The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.
â€œI quite understand that,â€ he replied deliberately.
Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!
When she was at the station she saw crowds and bustle.
â€œDonâ€™t play a game with me,â€ he said dangerously.
But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.
â€œShall you come with me to Italy, Allaye?â€  â€œYes.
So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.
A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.
There were quarries near the railway, and men working.
The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.
â€œCome in, and warm yourself,â€ said the young woman.
It was freezing, the mountain high-road was congealed.
And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.
There was one cup, one enamelled mug, one little bowl.
It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.
She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.
But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.
She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.
â€œWould you?â€  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.
â€œHow nice they are!â€ said Alvina when she had left.
He was thin, and very shabby, and rather out of shape.
She only had his passive self, and his family passion.
She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.
He was a dandy with pale grey eyes and a heavy figure.

â€œGood-evening, Mr. Tripp,â€ said Mrs. Rand, politely.
â€œFrom Chicago, maâ€™am.â€  â€œWere you at work there?
â€œGlad to see you, widder,â€ said Silas Tripp, grimly.
Everything was new to him, and, of course, interesting.
â€œDo you always eat here, Mr. Conrad?â€ asked Chester.
â€œNo; sometimes it is more convenient to go elsewhere.

She carried it over her arm down to the Minersâ€™ Arms.
The poor invalid heard every clack and every vibration.
Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her.
Everybody he met he stopped, to talk Connection Meadow.
In Vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering.
Over Alexanderâ€™s letter Miss Frost shed bitter tears.
It seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take.
There was a great bustle, preparing her nursing outfit.
For in her latter half she had to visit the slum cases.
It cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough.
And yetâ€”and yetâ€”it was a right which was fulfilled.
And there was an abundance of Throttle-Haâ€™penny coal.
Wherein lies every moral that mankind can wish to draw.
Sorrow and a slow death, because a man had married her.
Iridescent goldenâ€”could anything be more fascinating!
With Miss Frost its spirit passed away: it was no more.
â€œGood morning, Mr. Witham,â€ replied Alvina brightly.
She felt as if she were really venturing on new ground.
Arthur lingered in the doorway a while, then went away.
He had accumulated some money, to add to his patrimony.
She questioned him about his plans, and about the Cape.
Look hereâ€”â€ And he began to pull up his trouser leg.
But Alvina had given the candle to Calladine, and fled.
For months, the thought of Albert was a torment to her.
Once she could plunge through the wall of the aquarium!
â€œWe never can understand those things,â€ said Alvina.
I can see nothing wrong with him,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Yet it was always packed with colliers and work-lasses.
He had decided he must make a percentage in other ways.
Alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically.
It nearly killed James to take the prices they offered.
Madame and the four young men had arrived at about six.
Itâ€™s his business to go.â€  â€œOh!â€ returned Alvina.
â€œIâ€™m afraid your cold is rather bad,â€ said Alvina.
â€œManca il cuore solamente al Ciccio,â€ moaned Madame.
Afterwards he was to carry up the horse-hair arm-chair.
My poor _braves_, what will they do without KishwÃ©gin?
The two tall Swiss looked down on him, faintly smiling.
He glanced round at Alvina, then went on with his work.
â€œWe like herâ€”we love herâ€”as if she were a mother.
From the head I am business-woman, good business-woman.
â€œAlors!â€ said Madame, cutting through this futility.
â€œDost thou want to go with him?â€ she asked suddenly.
Tell him that.â€  Geoffrey turned again into the house.
He looked at her sideways, furtively, but persistently.
And then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner!
But I wonâ€™t stay a minute.â€  â€œOh, it is all right.
â€œYou get dressed, Ciccio.â€  Ciccio looked at Alvina.
â€œDo you think I shall ever see you again?â€ she said.
The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.
She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.
He will not trouble you.â€  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.
But if you have decidedâ€”â€  Neither of them answered.
â€œMiss Houghton herself must decide.â€  â€œOh sureâ€”!
It wonâ€™t be much, then?â€  â€œReally, I donâ€™t know.
Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit.
â€œMadame is going to drive to the station,â€ she said.
â€œSo, we go together in the cab,â€ said Madame to him.
And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.
But she knew it was something improper, on her account.
Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.
And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.
Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.
He lifted his face to her, and shook his head slightly.
Whyâ€”â€ he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate.
â€œHow do you do?â€ and she thrust out her hand to him.
I mean them.â€  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.
You need to be looked after.â€  â€œDo I, Miss Pinnegar!
Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.
Comment allez-vous, alors?â€  â€œBien!â€ said Geoffrey.
â€œBut I might be afraid of a husband-bear,â€ she said.
â€œYes, they both slept in the end room,â€ said Alvina.
I donâ€™t think so.â€  â€œBut even then,â€ said Alvina.
When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.
â€œGive this letter to Madame,â€ Alvina said to Ciccio.
Madame did not consider Alvinaâ€™s view very seriously.
And cucumbers are poison to everybody.â€  â€œ_Cum-bers!
â€œMen are always intruders,â€ he smiled to the matron.
He could put a nasty intonation into that monosyllable.
â€œCome,â€ he said, beckoning for her to give her hand.
â€œYou will take my ring.â€  â€œYes,â€ she said coldly.
There was a slight flavour of art and literature about.
There was a certain freemasonry in the matronâ€™s room.
The Tukes were not very richâ€”the young ones, that is.
I donâ€™t carry bags because my heart is rather groggy.
She would commit herself to him through every eternity.
They ran through Bromley and out into the open country.
For there behind, behind all the sunshine, was England.
She sat very still for a long time, almost an eternity.
The ship slowly put about, and backed into the harbour.
Some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness.
There was a sound of a rushing river, glacial-sounding.
He had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest.
â€œWe will sit here, as I do, to eat,â€ said Pancrazio.
Pancrazio was very happy if Alvina would accompany him.
Pancrazio went in and out, back and forth from his pot.
In the distance, Ossona hung at the edge of a platform.
Let him go to the piazza or to the wine-shop, and talk.
Alvina meanwhile would sew for the child, or spin wool.

In a short time they had reached the ministerâ€™s house.

But, Mr. Tripp, Iâ€™ve come here on business.â€  â€œHey?

â€œAnd you bring it to me?â€  â€œYes, it belongs to you.
He would keep the money himself, and conceal the record.
He, himself, had found it and kept it in his possession.
There was one thing, however, that Chester did not know.
He was playing with Mullins as a cat plays with a mouse.
He discharged Abel Wood soon after you went to New York.
â€œHeâ€™s a scamp!â€ commented the man from Minneapolis.
â€œAre you going to the theater, Chester?â€ asked Felix.
He was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us.
You had better go back,â€ and Ralston prepared to go on.
I was in luck.â€  â€œDo you get six dollars?â€  â€œMore.
â€œIsnâ€™t he here now?â€ demanded Silas, with surprise.
â€œIt is a wonderful place, Chester,â€ said Mr. Perkins.
A pickpocket took it while I was looking in at a window.
When Mr. Fairchild returned Felix delivered the message.
We donâ€™t want to be at the tail end of the procession.
â€œShanâ€™t I see you again, Mr. Wilson?â€ asked Edward.
It is two dollars more than I received at my last place.
She has     held out pretty firm, but she may yield yet.
I did not think to look.â€  â€œYour case is unfortunate.
Mullins, I havenâ€™t the least intention of harming you.
â€œThe next day my employer summoned me to his presence.
Perhaps all they lack is an occupation: in short, a job.
But the poor-spirited Woodhouse people were weak buyers.
The whole affair was ricketty, amateurish, and twopenny.
So she neither questioned nor accepted, but just let be.
At such times Miss Frostâ€™s heart went cold within her.
Act just for yourself, dearâ€”the rest doesnâ€™t matter.
If it had she would certainly never have entertained it.
But she had serious confidential talks with Dr. Fordham.
She ground her teeth and screamed and yelled with pains.
So Alvina spun her medal, and her medal came down tails.
This was the end of another womanâ€™s life: such an end!
Her motherâ€™s little sitting-room was cold and disused.
It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master.
â€œBut we donâ€™t want father to go on with this scheme.
He seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element.
â€œNo, I donâ€™t know so much about that,â€ said Albert.
But it has its attractions.â€ Here he smiled meaningful.
Without a thought, she turned on her heel and fled away.
â€œAre you hurt?â€ called Alvina, looking up into space.
â€œWhich way?â€ she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.
In the Withamsâ€™ pew sat Lottie and Albertâ€”no Arthur.
â€œYou never spoke to Mr. Witham?â€ Miss Pinnegar asked.
Now he found himself more or less stranded in Woodhouse.
And he always walked down to Lumley to post his letters.
Once they had gone cold, they would never warm up again.
She hurried off to her bedroom to laugh and cry at once.
And swampedâ€”_swamped_ with her dirty old carrot water.
I saw her at a friendâ€™s when I came back from America.
She scorned to count â€œWelcome All.â€ Mr. May said Yes.
But she marched down one of the pews, and took her seat.
But Miss Pinnegar was sadly hot and squeezed in her pew.
Sudden curtain, and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers.
Miss Poppy herself sets all store on her cup and saucer.
â€œHow much have we taken, father?â€ asked Alvina gaily.
â€œIâ€™ve brought you the cough stuff,â€ said the widow.
She had dropped the cigarette unnoticed into the hearth.
â€œBut perhaps tomorrow.â€  â€œNo, today,â€ said Madame.
Alvina began to understand Madameâ€™s subjection to him.
The bear drops Ciccio lifeless, and turns to KishwÃ©gin.
â€œI should love to go.â€  He looked down into her eyes.
Why are you at all?â€  â€œNonsensical?â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œAnd what about yellow eyes?â€ asked Alvina, laughing.
â€œMay I hear it too?â€  â€œOh,â€ said Madame, drawling.
â€œComment?â€ queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.
And how?â€”and where?â€”in this country?â€”tell me that.
Is he quite obstinate?â€  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.
Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.
Finish this week and then go, goâ€”But finish this week.
â€œDo come!â€ she urged, never taking her eyes from him.
â€œWonâ€™t you come?â€ She smiled strangely and vividly.
Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.
True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.
â€œI should like awfullyâ€”â€ a flush grew on her cheek.
Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.
The doctor cameâ€”she went to the registrarâ€”and so on.
But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.
He went ducking along the dark yard, nearly to the gate.
â€œOn ne fume pas dans le salon,â€ said Madame brutally.
Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.
â€œWhat about the theatre?â€”will it go on?â€ she asked.
I donâ€™t know, she doesnâ€™t seem to hook on, does she?
Sheâ€™d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.
â€œI couldnâ€™t keep away from you, Madame,â€ she cried.
You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.
â€œYet he promised.â€  Again Madame smiled sardonically.
â€œSee, my dear, that your money is safe,â€ said Madame.
â€œWhat a good brooch, eh?â€ Madame fingered the brooch.
Madame sat at one end of the table, Alvina at the other.
There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.
â€œPacohuila!â€ cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.
When she came to her door, she turned and looked at him.
Aâ€™ open â€™eart â€™s worth all your bum-righteousness.
â€œYou can have that if you like, Madame,â€ said Alvina.
And the next day the same, she was all icy pleasantness.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.
And instinct told her that he might ignore her for ever.
But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.
â€œThe best!â€ He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.
And your father a month dead.â€  â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter.
â€œHow not like it!â€  â€œI donâ€™t like it,â€ she said.
He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.
Donâ€™t you all?â€  The two other men smiled and nodded.
Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.
Itâ€™s almost _White Slave Traffic_, on Madameâ€™s part.
â€œI love thee, I love thee as a brother, and also more.
She didnâ€™t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.
I wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation.
Alvina did _not_ want to go to Mansfield that afternoon.
But their hearts hardened with black, indomitable anger.
But Alvina felt herself particularly excluded, left out.
Then she wired home to her doctor for another reference.
She went rapidly from case to case, as she was summoned.
â€œWhy I do ten times the work that any one of you does.
came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina.
But I think Iâ€™m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.
They went downstairs, and Alvina returned to her duties.
â€œThe pains have begun,â€ said Alvina, hurrying to her.
But the doctor had replied that Nurse would ring him up.
She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster.
â€œOf course!â€â€”another of Mrs. Tukeâ€™s exclamations.
He came to her, smiling softly, to take her in his arms.
England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging.
Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions.
â€œI think itâ€™s lovelyâ€”wonderful,â€ she said, dazed.
Err!â€ cried Pancrazio, striking the beast on the flank.
Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water.
Alvina came out of the icy bedroom to the black kitchen.
Then she scrubbed the two little tables and the shelves.
His yellow, luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her.
Beautiful, in our musical sense of the word, it was not.
â€˜So now I was obstinate, and I said _Three oâ€™clock_.
Fortunately he was turning round talking to another man.
In her room they opened into a grand bowl of lilac fire.
Everywhere little grape hyacinths hung their blue bells.
But nothing could be more exquisite, like gods on earth.
â€œMust they all be cut?â€ she said, as she went to him.
She would find the English Consul and he would help her.
Oratory, like poetry, is emotional, as Longinus asserts.
This is logically followed by the ten attributes of man.
About her are mirrors and the fragrant fumes of incense.
A further example of this idea is furnished by Timocles.
When he defends comedy, Lodge drifts away from allegory.

Could he send her enough from the city to help her along?
There was a table near the window with a portfolio on it.
â€œWhat can I do for you?â€ he asked, in a careless tone.
Mrs. Long, with the baby in her arms, answered the knock.
When I was in the store yesterday, he inquired after you.
For the present, therefore, I feel obliged to retain him.
It will depend on the success I meet with in my business.
Now we can talk freely.â€  â€œThatâ€™s what I came about.
Why, I started off on a sudden without consulting anyone.
You will get no help from him.â€  â€œI begin to think so.
Iâ€™ll return it soon,â€ said Radcliff, looking relieved.
I would rather have my own business and be my own master.
â€œThat canâ€™t be possible!â€  â€œIt is a fact, however.
You were out in a boat yourself, and saw the whole thing.
â€œYes,â€ answered the poor mother, in a spiritless tone.
But one chronic and dreary malady: that of the odd women.
He expected to get at least ten thousand pounds with her.
He flitted, with a tense look on his face, to Manchester.
True, he became also Superintendent of the Sunday School.
One would have expected his Ã¦sthetic eye to be offended.
And this it was, perhaps, that scared away the young men.
â€œI donâ€™t really know,â€ she said, laughing hurriedly.
She knew the same would ring in her motherâ€™s dying cry.
They all seemed like blank sheets of paper in comparison.
She enjoyed the smell of a toasted bloater, rather burnt.
It certainly is not what we think we are and ought to be.
She was returning to Woodhouse virgin as she had left it.
With Miss Frost all was openness, explicit and downright.
But Alvina liked to be with Miss Pinnegar in the kitchen.
In the afternoon, directly after dinner, Alvina went out.
And of course, Alvina was considered a lady in Woodhouse.
â€œIs this one of your old walks?â€ she asked, malicious.
It feels a little cramped, you know, after a new country.
Putting her umbrella between him and her, she walked off.
â€œLet us go down,â€ said Mr. May, â€œand look at a site.
I never was in a worse, in all the _cauce_ of my travels.
You must be prepared to spend something at the beginning.
â€œIn the theatrical line, Iâ€™m sure,â€ declared Alvina.
Alvina hastily retreated, but Miss Pinnegar stood it out.
Chot-let, penny a bar!â€ away she banged at another tune.
He came fairly frequently to Manchester House after this.
When he got home he hurried upstairs to his bare chamber.
Time after time James ran his almighty eye over his army.
He was quite sincere: if man ever _can_ be quite sincere.
She wondered where he got them, and how he afforded them.
He cocked his blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened.
She was _dÃ©classÃ©e_: she had lost her class altogether.
And they had always a certain fund of callous philosophy.
As they went up the entry they heard the sound of voices.
The young men looked at her, and muttered to one another.
â€œChe natura povera, senza sentimentoâ€”niente di bello.
He was quite drunk with his first sleep, and saw nothing.
Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.
Youâ€™ve never been out of England?â€  â€œNo,â€ she said.
And then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business.
I am an old womanâ€”â€  â€œYounger than I,â€ said Alvina.
And now let me give you one little token of my gratitude.
Alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage.
â€œAre they both staying, or only one?â€ she said tartly.
â€œWill you come to dinner?â€ she said to her two guests.
â€œWhat _is_ his name, Madame?â€  â€œMarascaâ€”Francesco.
Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her.
Pity some nice young man doesnâ€™t turn up and marry her.
Bitterly she cried, when she bent down during the prayer.
She had watched them for her motherâ€”and for Miss Frost.
And they all told her they thought _their_ plan was best.
â€œAnd all the business, the will and all?â€ said Madame.
â€œCertainly,â€ said Louis, bowing also over his tea-cup.
â€œNow then,â€ said Madame briskly, â€œwe are all agreed.
And the young men stirred uneasily, and smiled furtively.
â€œHuronsâ€”Hirondelles, means _swallows_,â€ said Madame.
Madame locked up the jewels quickly, after one last look.
By the train, or the bicycle?â€  â€œTrain,â€ said Ciccio.
Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m glad to leave it.â€ There was a pause.
La pauvre filleâ€”pauvre demoiselle!â€ lamented Geoffrey.
Miss Pinnegar wilted and felt strange under so many eyes.
Mr. May laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over.
Oh!â€  â€œNot if you think those thingsâ€”â€ said Alvina.
Noises went on, in the street, overhead in the work-room.
It was already ten oâ€™clock when she hurried downstairs.
Then heâ€™d believe in you.â€  But Ciccio shook his head.
â€œDoes it mean we owe seven hundred pounds?â€ she asked.
I canâ€™t believe it.â€  â€œSo he told me,â€ said Alvina.
â€œWhat are we to do?â€ said Max, pale on the cheekbones.
Curse them!â€ Louis was muttering, in his rolling accent.
They kept within the four-square enclosure of themselves.
â€œPffâ€”!â€ he went, with a whistling sound of contempt.
She would go straight to Windermere, to see the big lake.
She was in good health, and she was getting fatter again.
â€œWhatâ€™s that, mister?â€ replied the mystified hawker.
â€œThere!â€ she said, bobbing a little curtsey to Alvina.
Lancaster was busy with a sort of fÃªte, notwithstanding.
â€œI felt I ought to do something.â€  â€œWhy?â€ he asked.
Upon it was the mourning-ring Miss Frost had always worn.
â€œI may congratulate _you_, you mean,â€ said the matron.
And it cast a slight slur of vulgar familiarity over her.
This she gathered from her contact with the local gentry.
Alvina comforted her and reassured her as best she could.
And to make me howl because Iâ€™ve got a child inside me.
He swallowed his in one swallow, and put aside his glass.
The faint, stupid half-smile, half-sneer was on his lips.
â€œShe is going to have a child,â€ said Alvina to Ciccio.
Alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert Ciccio.
How sick she was of other people and their importunities!
Ciccioâ€™s a treat to be with, because heâ€™s so natural.
And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell.
It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her.
CHAPTER XIV THE JOURNEY ACROSS   The train began to move.
All was very still in the wintry sunshine of the Channel.
It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light.
I know I shall.â€  â€œI say _no_, brother,â€ said Ciccio.
And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.
But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad.
Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant.
And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced.
He had his cloak over his nose and his hat over his eyes.
It was rather like the crying of half-articulate animals.
Alvina sat with Ciccio stripping them, in the corn-place.
This was where Ciccio belonged: his active, mindful self.
She came upon a bankside all wide with lavender crocuses.
The high-road was depressing, wherever there were houses.
Rose-red and gold-yellow of the flowers swam in her eyes.
Such drama Aeschylus asserts to be immoral in its effect.
They had looked to the poets for moral dogma and example.

But how came you hither, Gentlemen, how durst you venture?
Marry, Sir, and the wiser he; for they got nothing byâ€™t.
Yes, though the Sight wouâ€™d blast me, I wouâ€™d view it.
Why, what the Devilâ€™s your Business, and you go to that?
But what makes ye out at this Hour, and with these Jewels?
Stay, _Julia_--your Will shall be obeyâ€™d,    [_Sighing_.

â€œI have sympathy for all who are out of work,â€ he said.
In fact, nothing at all,â€ Chester was obliged to confess.
He would have been a bright boy if he had kept his health.
I donâ€™t draw all the time,â€ said Chester, with a smile.
We     may be able to throw considerable work in your way.
He took the elevator and went upstairs to the sixth floor.
She was rather surprised when she saw who her visitor was.
â€œBravo, Arthur,â€ said Prof. Nugent, clapping his hands.
Have you got a place?â€ asked Mullins, turning to Chester.
â€œEighteen hundred dollars?â€ the latter repeated, aloud.
â€œIâ€™d like to know what all this means,â€ said Ralston.
â€œHow is that?â€ inquired Chester, in a tone of sympathy.
Once I heard your stepfather complaining bitterly of this.
I have some property at Tacoma.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t mean it!
â€œCan you furnish any evidence of this?â€ asked Mr. Dean.
I understood that my treacherous friend had given me away.
â€œWe have been separated long enough, Edward,â€ she said.
They all _wanted_ the middle-class girls to find husbands.
But no, they would rather give sixpence-halfpenny for W.H.
It was an ugly brick, painfully heavy and parched-looking.
But owing to her change of heart, she lingered indecisive.
With cold eyes she looked at him, and found him repugnant.
Alvina felt very strong and rich in the fact of her youth.
And they behaved as if she were exactly one of themselves.
Sometimes she wondered to herself, over her own virginity.
And at the same time, she had to constitute herself nurse.
She kept quietly on her own ground, and left you on yours.
Slaves who would cause the superimposed day-order to fall.
â€œYes, I shall remember,â€ said Alvina, beyond tears now.
â€œWell, weâ€™ll see,â€ said James, rising to superiority.
â€œThatâ€™s what it is,â€ said Miss Pinnegar vindictively.
And then, to be taught to ride a bicycle by Albert Witham!
It was like the jaws of a pair of insentient iron pincers.
â€œI canâ€™t imagine,â€ replied Miss Pinnegar, eyeing her.
She rebelled with all her backbone against the word _job_.
This man had catered for the little shows of little towns.
And now, in very low water, he found himself at Woodhouse.
And with those fatal words he wafted away to find Mr. May.
â€œOhâ€”Miss Pinnegar!â€ he said, and made to slip by her.
Which man?â€  James was a little deaf, and a little husky.
Houghton!â€ said Miss Pinnegar, in a sudden changed voice.
Come and Buy Without Price.â€  James was in his eye-holes.
But he exacted that they should buy one article at a time.
And yet she remained good friends with the odd little man.
Mr. Houghton was very much concerned over Madameâ€™s cold.
There was a slight look of self-commiseration on her face.
And so, what will they do without their old _gouvernante_?
â€œIs it my _appearance_ you laugh at, or is it only _me_?
Well, wellâ€”it makes you wonder what is and what isnâ€™t.
The foreigners shrugged their shoulders, and paid no heed.
They sent him off to other artistes, other lodging-houses.
Can I make Miss Houghtonâ€™s father lose these two nights?
It was all very well for Alvina to bang the piano crossly.
At five minutes to nine, she hurried off to Mrs. Rollings.
â€œLeave me alone.â€ But he looked anything but all right.
Hearing the gate bang, she rose and hurried to the window.
Tomorrow was Sunday: and the funeral was in the afternoon.
â€œYou do not know him yet,â€ she said, turning to Alvina.
The meal, with the three women at table, passed painfully.
We must catch the train.â€  â€œOh butâ€”wonâ€™t you drive?
â€œAnd if there is something?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know either.
Wait one moment.â€ She went to the door and called Ciccio.
Why sure!â€  â€œItâ€™s dreadful, thoughâ€”!â€ said Alvina.
Max, as being the responsible party, looked business-like.
â€œAnd Miss Houghton shall have her professional name, eh?
Each _brave_ also kissed her hand, with a profound salute.
And she looked back at him, heavy-eyed and half subjected.
â€œThe gift of Pacohuila you know,â€ said Madame, smiling.
Onâ€™y weâ€™ve got to keep up appearances a bit, you know.
How _can_ youâ€”â€  Alvina was hustled off to her lodging.
With what close curiosity Madame examined the ruby brooch.
â€œI am tired, I shall go early to my room,â€ said Alvina.
â€œNa Cicâ€™â€”â€ he said, as he saw Ciccio in the street.
They were a good-humoured company in the railway carriage.
â€œEat!â€ he said to her, smiling, motioning to her plate.
Your poor father!â€  â€œIâ€™m sure the dead are all right.
â€œThis was my motherâ€™s little sitting-room,â€ she said.
And closing her book, she rose and went to the other room.
This house, and all it contains?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Alvina.
â€œVoyez, un cochon de lait,â€ said Gigi amply and calmly.
Geoffrey rose to his feet and flung his arms round Ciccio.
When Ciccio returned, Alvina was once more washing dishes.
Her eyes looked back at him, hard and cold and determined.
In truth, she loved himâ€”and she was laughing to herself.
She sang to herself as she went about her work downstairs.
Nothing is oursâ€”not even the plate youâ€™re eating from.
â€œThey want to say we are immoral foreigners,â€ she said.
â€œAnd never no different.â€  â€œNever,â€ said the doctor.
â€œMine _isna_, tha sees,â€ he said, â€œso papâ€™s no use.
â€œYouâ€™ll give me time to wonder about you, wonâ€™t you?
â€œIâ€™ve volunteered for active service,â€ she stammered.
â€œAfter Christmas!â€ he started as if he had been bitten.
Already she belonged to the revered caste of medicine-men.
Connected with him, she was a known and labelled quantity.
Mrs. Tuke was the wife of the son of a local manufacturer.
â€œJe ne peux pas entrer.â€  â€œVous ne pouvez pas entrer?
She went slowly down the stairs and out of the front door.
I canâ€™t bear it,â€ cried the strange voice of Mrs. Tuke.
He was heard talking to some one in the moonlight outside.
The moment Mrs. Tuke recovered her breath she began again.
I say, nurse, excuse me, but I like you better in uniform.
If the manâ€™s good enough, heâ€™s good enough by himself.
But the slow, remote look in her eyes made this fall flat.
â€œWhat was your motherâ€™s name?â€ Ciccio was asking her.
Her thoughts flew to Woodhouse, the grey centre of it all.
Alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like.
She was rather smoke-dried too, from perpetual wood-smoke.
There had been a little garden within the stone enclosure.
She felt the strange terror and loveliness of his passion.
A black hatred for the Mitchells of this world filled her.
But none the less the houses were sordid, unkempt, slummy.
She had to hide in her room till the cold wind blew again.
â€œIâ€™ll come back, and weâ€™ll go to America,â€ he said.
The Scholastic Grouping of Poetic, Rhetoric and Logic   2.
Even more obscure is its applicability to Hawes's subject.
A few figures of speech are mentioned, but not dwelt upon.
The figures Puttenham divides according to his own scheme.
Puttenham was a bad poet, a well-read man, and a courtier.
Isocrates made his reply in his speech _On the Antidosis_.
Everything is low and contracted, especially the doorways.
They now absolutely refused to go any farther without him.
This is not so bad on the broad streets of a Russian town.
We were obliged to dismount in the principal thoroughfare.

â€œThree dollars a week!â€  â€œItâ€™s what I call high pay.
I donâ€™t want to brag, but I never spent a cent foolishly.
â€œI should like to be an artist,â€ he said, after a pause.
And for the first time it dawned upon him he was an artist.
â€œHow much would you be willing to give?â€ put in Chester.
â€œYou will find that you will work better in a great city.
â€œWhy, mother,â€ said Rob, â€œis that you?â€  â€œYes, Rob.
You will know more about him in a week than I can tell you.
He walked up to the desk where the book keeper was writing.
â€œI was a fool that I didnâ€™t destroy it,â€ he reflected.
Otherwise, how could James Long have recovered the receipt?
It was one chance, not a very good one, but still a chance.
I havenâ€™t missed any.â€  â€œI wish he would help himself.
He looked like a man of leisure, with little upon his mind.
â€œIt mightâ€”â€”â€  Chester lost the rest of the sentence.
I never heard the name before.â€  Chester looked surprised.
â€œOh, you mean our office boy,â€ returned Mullins, coldly.
Where shall I direct?â€  â€œOh, just direct to Minneapolis.
â€œI wouldnâ€™t trust him any further than I could see him.
As for your son, you can only leave him to his own devices.
It was located in a large office building on Nassau Street.
Everything betokened prosperity, and Mr. Tripp was dazzled.
I come from Wyncombe, where he lives, and I know his folks.
â€œMebbe Chester isnâ€™t adapted to the city,â€ Silas said.
â€œWhat is the matter, my boy?â€ asked Sharpleigh, blandly.
â€œI have spent over a year in the city, mother,â€ he said.
Abner Trimble looked disappointed, but did not dare object.
â€œSome of them do a great deal of good,â€ said the lawyer.
Besides, heâ€™s got a new suit of clothes and a gold watch.
Now James Houghton had only one child: his daughter Alvina.
A manageress was advertised for, and work-girls were hired.
And doubtful if James was ever grateful for their presence.
His rather large, grey moustache was brushed off his mouth.
Alvina should have been preparing her trousseau, to follow.
But she never found there what she found in her photograph.
They were alert, their faces were clean and bright-looking.
It was August when she came home, in her nurseâ€™s uniform.
But for her mother she had to remove her nurseâ€™s uniform.
The future remains for ever an infinite field for mistakes.
Sorrow and slow death, because a man had _not_ married her.
Our mothers pined because our fathers drank and were rakes.
When what was wanted was a Dark Master from the underworld.
They were everything to one another, Miss Frost and Alvina.
Miss Allsop, daughter of the builder, called to see Alvina.
She would not care about marriage, if even she had a lover.
It hampers them, and interferes with their power of action.
She remembered Arthur had the same look, bending to prayer.
If help came, it would have to come from the extraordinary.
â€œGood-morning!â€ said Mr. May, stopping before the woman.
â€œAlvina!â€ Miss Pinnegar called discreetly down the shop.
â€œI might have put some in, if Iâ€™d known,â€ said Alvina.
â€œI suppose I donâ€™t have any say.â€  â€œOh but _surely_.
He darted out to drive James round in front of the curtain.
Didnâ€™t it?â€ And he laughed a high, excited little laugh.
Oh, I fell between the two stools beautifully, beautifully!
Could the devil himself have invented anything more trying?
And they hate it.â€  Mr. May watched her long and dismally.
She was surprised to hear Mr. Mayâ€™s opinion of the navvy.
But she found it amusing to see them all and know them all.
Madame had insisted on cooking the chops for the young men.
He was dark, rather tall and loose, with yellow-tawny eyes.
Will you please to sit down.â€  They all took their chairs.
â€œI must go home for some things,â€ said Alvina to Ciccio.
â€œOh well, if you think so,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, nettled.
How she hated seething in the bath of her own perspiration.
Max solemnly, Louis gallant, the other two dumb and sleepy.
It was eight oâ€™clock before she asked her first question.
Alvina started and looked round at her with wide blue eyes.
â€œLet us go,â€ said Mr. May, bubbling with new importance.
Max slipped on a tattered hunting-shirt and cartridge belt.
KishwÃ©gin examines the bear, Ciccio examines the prisoner.
You see, thatâ€™s it.â€  â€œBut how has Madame made it all?
â€œAnd I am very glad you have been such a good KishwÃ©gin.
Let us see.â€  So gradually Max was brought to stand still.
He will perhaps wait for me at his cousinâ€™s in Battersea.
And then one met the yellow pupils, sulphureous and remote.
â€œI am so sorry youâ€™re going away,â€ she said nervously.
She moaned in spirit, in his arms, felt herself dead, dead.
She left everything now to Miss Pinnegar and Mrs. Rollings.
She closed the door and ushered them into the drawing-room.
Madame glanced round, as she did in every room she entered.
She scrutinized Alvina with her eyes of bright black glass.
â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Madame, cutting her meat quickly.
â€œGood-bye!â€ Madame fluttered a black-edged handkerchief.
And so should I without you,â€ said Miss Pinnegar doggedly.
There was something less than a hundred pounds in the bank.
â€œAssez de cette Ã©ternelle voix italienne,â€ said Madame.
Ciccio got up quickly and took his mandoline from its case.
Then she waved for a partner, and set up a tarantella wail.
â€œKishwÃ©gin must open your doors for you all,â€ she said.
She either ousted her landlady, or used her as second cook.
She was a spoke in their wheel, a scotch to their facility.
He fumbled in his pocket for a pencil and a piece of paper.
Then I shall look as if Iâ€™d just been taking a _journey_.
And is _this_ quite final, too?â€  â€œQuite,â€ said Alvina.
Pacohuila, Walgatchka, Allayeâ€”â€  He smiled very broadly.
â€œYou have done it all, eh?â€ said Ciccio, glancing round.
White, and mute, and motionless, she was taken to her room.
He approached, laid his hand on her breast, and kissed her.
â€œYou didnâ€™t expect it would be quite so bad?â€ he said.
Now she had nothing, he would coolly withhold this respect.
â€œYou might almost have expected it,â€ said Mrs. Rollings.
On the other hand, the theatre was sold for almost nothing.
And therefore, everything went charmingly at the Town Hall.
To be told by _you_ what will do you harm and what wonâ€™t?
I never touch alcohol in any form.â€  â€œNo, anâ€™ I dunna.
â€œToday is the day when you answer, isnâ€™t it?â€ he said.
She watched him, and wondered why on earth all this frenzy.
Which made her rather abashed, and much more uncomfortable.
At such a moment, what was the good of saying she didnâ€™t?
She did not know the other man; some theatrical individual.
Mrs. Tuke was quite still, resting her chin on her fingers.
â€œDo put me down!â€ murmured Alvina, stirring in his arms.
How can I depend on you at all?â€  Again he shook his head.
What was the good of trying to be Miss Houghton any longer?
Next to Alvina sat a trim Frenchwoman reading _Lâ€™Aiglon_.
He glanced at her from time to time, smiling constrainedly.
Then a tall bright schooner glimmered far down the channel.
Then the long night journey through France, slow and blind.
Many people alighted from the train, many surged to get in.
And the conversation once more became a spatter of Italian.
So the train clambered up and down, and went round corners.
â€œMy sisterâ€™s husband lives here,â€ explained Pancrazio.
â€œThen we will get the donkey,â€ said Pancrazio stoically.
Pancrazio came hurrying back to the plank with the lantern.
â€œWhy not?â€ she cried, in panic lest he prophesied truly.
Ciccio sat down on a chair and began to take off his boots.
It was impossible for her to become one with it altogether.
â€œYou wouldnâ€™t be happy here, so long,â€ he said, sadly.
â€˜Now you have had a taste of the cross,â€™ I said to him.
She loved the quality of his silence, so rich and physical.
There she sewed and spun wool and read, and learnt Italian.
â€œAre you sorry you came here with me, Allaye?â€ he asked.

Whatâ€™ll you charge to shovel a path?â€  Chester hesitated.
â€œNo, sir, but I have read about itâ€”and dreamed about it.
The money received from the minister enabled him to do this.
â€œThat used to belong to A. T. Stewart, the great merchant.
â€œNo; it will be better for you to secure a boarding place.
â€œWhy, this is famous,â€ exclaimed Conrad, looking pleased.
You must win the money to pay your debt at the gaming table.
The bookkeeper met with varying success at the gaming table.
Iâ€™m not quite up to that in the present state of my funds.
Did you wish to see him?â€  About this Chester was in doubt.

I shall write out to a friend in Portland to buy me as many.

I hear that he is     circulating reports that you are dead.
He had evidently produced a good impression on Mrs. Trimble.
In which he was disappointed, for he got only eight hundred.
James certainly had an irritating way of speaking of a book.
James Houghton designed â€œrobes.â€ Now Robes were the mode.
But what James lost downstairs he tried to recover upstairs.
Heaven knows what he would have done, but for Miss Pinnegar.
He saw himself making noble provision for his only daughter.
He was amiable and polite, laughed often, showing his teeth.
She seemed to see a strong mouthful of cruel, compact teeth.
They all waited for the old loving Vina to be herself again.
Alvina expected to become frightened, as the time drew near.
Every moment, in the swing, living, or active in full swing.
A lovely edelweissâ€”but time it was gathered into eternity.
Here was Clariss Houghton, married, and a motherâ€”and dead.
Then again they closedâ€”only to open again tense with pain.
The nearest relatives came down, and everything was settled.
â€œDrink!â€  Alvina sank down and laughed till she was weak.
â€œWhat will he say now?â€ he asked, with self-satisfaction.
â€œShall we have a light, Alvina?â€ he said to his daughter.
â€œIâ€™ll make my way home.â€  â€œSo will I,â€ she answered.
True enough, she still preferred to be thought of as a girl.
And he darenâ€™t confess it to James, who, he knew, was T-T.
His waistcoat, with its grey satin back, fitted him tightly.
He had filled outâ€”but he hadnâ€™t developed a corporation.
Here they took the chessboard and pretended to start a game.
She had never collapsed, she had never fallen into hysteria.
He was eating his dinner, and seemed oblivious of her entry.
â€œSheâ€™s an impossible person.â€  â€œI see,â€ said Alvina.
Live on three lettuce leaves, and give the rest to the char.
â€œOh!â€ he turned his eyes to heaven, and spread his hands.
Feverish but content, James shut the shop for the last time.
Mr. May had worked hard to get a program for the first week.
It was exactly the excited, crowded audience Mr. May wanted.
Always in the morning, when I was on the alert for business.
Alvina tried to fathom what the young fellowâ€™s look meant.
And all three turned round, to find all three turning round.
La bonne demoiselleâ€”la bonne demoiselleâ€”elle a du coeur.
She couldnâ€™t make heads or tails of him, and didnâ€™t try.
Max, the only stubborn watcher, shook his head lugubriously.
Do you know that?â€  â€œI _didnâ€™t_ know it,â€ said Alvina.
But she was most careful never to give any room for scandal.
â€œI feel it is unlucky for me.â€  â€œDo you?â€ said Alvina.
Let us swear a closer fidelity, dear Madame, our KishwÃ©gin.
In the morning she was up betimes, sending a note to Alvina.
We are all friends, arenâ€™t we, all the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras?
She had decided to dance the next night, the Saturday night.
â€œWellâ€”not so strong as usualâ€”but not so bad, you know.
She walked up with Mr. May, and hardly noticed he was there.
Whoâ€™s the other?â€ Miss Pinnegar looked sharply at Alvina.
He sticks to nothingâ€”â€  â€œHow old is he?â€ asked Alvina.
I donâ€™t know Miss Houghtonâ€™s intentions,â€ said Mr. May.
â€œYou should form a company, and carry onâ€”â€ said Madame.
No, thatâ€™s her fatherâ€™s cousin who sheâ€™s walking with.
And so everybody began to say â€œIâ€™m getting tired of her.
A thousand pounds?â€  â€œOh, itâ€™s just possible, you know.
Mind it is not lost.â€  â€œItâ€™s all I have,â€ said Alvina.
Alvina unfastened her bag and counted the crisp white notes.
Only a real fear of offending Madame drove her down at last.
â€œGood-night all.â€  They rose and bowed their good-nights.
We go by the Great Central as far as the junction, together.
He covered it for one moment with his hand, then ignored it.
â€œYouâ€™re not asking him to stay the night,â€ she blurted.
â€œWould you like to see the house?â€ said Alvina to Ciccio.
He laid his hand on the keys of the piano, sounding a chord.
â€œAnd write the name of your father and mother,â€ she said.
nâ€™est-ce pas?â€  â€œYâ€™a place pour trois,â€ said Ciccio.
â€œWhat would your _father_ say to this?â€ she said sternly.
I donâ€™t know how ever youâ€™ll be saved, after such a sin.
Then she went upstairs, to do the bedrooms and pack her bag.
â€œYouâ€™ll really have to go if you are to catch the train.
There you are!â€ Madame smiled archly, and rather mockingly.
And therefore, the next day, everything went as if by magic.
You mustnâ€™t look, or youâ€™re done for.â€  Alvina laughed.
Youâ€™re that fond of them?â€  â€œI find they agree with me.
When do you think _I_ can sit at table and digest my dinner?
He had a pleasant old square house with a big walled garden.
â€œWe might make a tour of the Lakes before long,â€ he said.
He was a big man in a navy blue suit, with very white teeth.
That was how it put itself to her: she would take it all on.
He smiled broadly, but with a tension of nervous excitement.
For one thing, mere curiosity made her want to see the ring.
Love me!â€  Alvina was absolutely dumbfounded by this scene.
She extricated her hand, and held out her engagement finger.
â€œYou never know what men will do till youâ€™ve known them.
He had turned with the rest, looking inquiringly at the car.
On nâ€™entre pasâ€”â€ called the well-known voice of Ciccio.
From a bush at the side she pulled two sweet-smelling roses.
I want you,â€ sang the uneasy, querulous voice of Mrs. Tuke.
And he was more angry than ever, because her watch was slow.
Alvina remained with her hair-brush suspended, watching him.
â€œI shall go where I like.â€  But slowly he shook his head.
The official scrutinized her, and asked questions of Ciccio.
Alvina got a placeâ€”but Ciccio had to stay in the corridor.
The train came to sudden halts, and stood still in the snow.
She looked at Ciccio, and he looked back at her, doubtingly.
â€œWhat are they doing?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Ciccio.
For though the fire was warm in front, behind was very cold.
But Giovanni blew on, his eyes sparkling, looking to Alvina.
Then deliberately she got out of bed and went across to him.
Well, the model had to be tied hanging on to a wooden cross.
You must never come so far alone.â€  â€œWhy not?â€ she said.
It is only for old men,â€ he said, talking of Pescocalascio.
Pancrazio would tell Alvina about his wife and her ailments.
â€œI havenâ€™t any hope,â€ he said, in a dull, dogged voice.
But he still sat with his hands abandoned between his knees.
He writes as a poet to young men who desire to become poets.
Tully, the only orator mentioned, shares a line with Virgil.
Yet it is the most characteristic Latin rhetoric we possess.
The diction of poetry is the same as the diction of oratory.
Eratosthenes took an extreme view in seeking pleasure alone.
Thus all arts proceed from it, and rhetoric is a part of it.
That poetry did have this improving effect he is quite sure.
This is almost exactly Aristotle's phrase in the _Rhetoric_.

His mother looked at him in surprise as he entered the house.
â€œDo you knew Mr. Fairchild?â€ he at length asked, abruptly.
But you must buy me a package of cigarettes.â€  â€œVery well.
â€œHowever, heâ€™ll soon break over his virtuous resolutions.
â€œI come from Mr. Fairchildâ€™s office,â€ explained Chester.
â€œIs he sick or in pain?â€ asked Chester, in quick sympathy.
â€œErnest has found a friend, Margaret,â€ said the professor.
â€œYou might set up a jewelerâ€™s store,â€ suggested Chester.
From motives of prudence I only risked five dollars at first.
Savagely I threw down the remaining five and won twenty-five.
I told him you were satisfied with your position in the city.
They must have cost him altogether as much as thirty dollars.
He had only been asked to inquire if Mr. Perkins had arrived.
â€œAre you Chester Rand?â€ he asked, in a high-pitched voice.
Iâ€™ve seen the town of Tacoma, where youâ€™ve got five lots.
Have you heard from Fairchild yet?â€  â€œNo; it isnâ€™t time.
I am discharged.â€  â€œWhat!â€ exclaimed Arthur, in surprise.
He received at his lodgings the following letter:      â€œMR.
It is backed by sufficient capital to     insure its success.
I may be able to do better afterward.â€  Chester was dazzled.
They were fortunate enough to win the approval of the editor.
â€œDid you hear anything of him?â€ Mrs. Rand naturally asked.
It wasnâ€™t true, but it was only an excuse to get rid of me.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter, Felix?â€ he said, as the boy entered.
â€œMeanwhile you are out of money, I suppose,â€ said Chester.
â€œLet me advise you to take some soup first,â€ said Chester.
â€œNow Iâ€™ll answer your questions,â€ said Nathaniel Wilson.
He says he has not had anyone to     suit him since you left.

In her way, Miss Pinnegar was very different from Miss Frost.
In her own way, she was as loyal and unselfish as Miss Frost.
James Houghtonâ€™s shop was regarded as a weekly comic issue.
But, becoming used to disillusionment, he almost welcomed it.
But a mining population scorned such dirt, as they called it.
The name Connection Meadow was forgotten within three months.
She seemed to nestle into the well-known surety of Woodhouse.
He semed to have no thought, no feeling for the girl herself.
She went through her training experiences like another being.
For a moment she surged in massive, inhuman, female strength.
There was something chaste, and noble, and war-like about it.
In short, he should have been somebody else, and not himself.
Remarkable how little trace her mother leftâ€”hardly a trace.
Going into the Liquor Vaults at ten oâ€™clock in the morning!
â€œIf you create a supply you create a demand,â€ he retorted.
She imagined him a taller, more fascinating, educated Arthur.
â€œIâ€™ll stroll up with you, if you donâ€™t mind,â€ he said.
She heard her fatherâ€™s step at last tripping down the shop.
â€œWhat has _he_ got to do with you?â€ said James shrewishly.
â€œWhat do you do on Sunday nights as a rule?â€ he asked her.
â€œItâ€™s many a day since I was on this railroad,â€ he said.
It was a nasty cut bruise, swelling and looking very painful.
â€œIâ€™ve made up my mind about Albert Witham,â€ said Alvina.
Then he would take her to South Africa: a whole new _milieu_.
Mr. May turned in to the Derby Hotel to have a small whiskey.
They found one barren patch where two caravans were standing.
The next morning he was ringing for his tea at six oâ€™clock.
Thatâ€™s Missisâ€™ sister.â€  â€œThe Three Bellsâ€”thank you.
â€œAnd which is the way to the station here?â€ asked Mr. May.
â€œFather might almost have sold him the suit,â€ said Alvina.
But Miss Pinnegar, the engine of wrath, felt she would burst.
â€œBuying a cinema showâ€”and that man we saw is his manager.
â€œFor in Spooney-ooney Island Is there any one cares for me?
None the less, Mr. May was dependable in matters of business.
â€œOh, fatherâ€™s in his eye-holes,â€ said Alvina to Mr. May.
Weâ€™n come ter hear tâ€™ parson.â€  Theme for endless jokes.
Thereâ€™s six nights to a week.â€ James was properly snubbed.
In vain the boy most pertinently yelled â€œChot-letâ€ at her.
On wet nights Woodhouse did not care to trail down to Lumley.
They didnâ€™t care a straw who you were or who you werenâ€™t.
Iâ€™ll see if thereâ€™s a fire in the bedroom,â€ said Alvina.
Geoffrey obediently went out with a lantern to the coal-shed.
But in vain Louis lifted Ciccioâ€™s shoulders from the table.
â€œWake up,â€ said Alvina, laughing, pressing his hand again.
You should see her dance round the bear, when I bring him in!
He glanced at her to see what she meant, what she understood.
James too started with a cry, the mob at the corner screamed.
The cavalcade fell into a trot, Mr. May shaking rather badly.
â€œThat is to say, to me, from an uncivilized German pig, ah?
Without him the company is ruinedâ€”until I get a substitute.
It is a little more than a year since we came to Knarborough.
He did not care very much whether he found his friend or not.
But for the sake of my honour, finish this week at Woodhouse.
â€œYouâ€™ll come with me to the door,â€ she said to Geoffrey.
Ciccio was just putting on the outer cover of his front tire.
â€œWhat have I said all along?â€  James was laid on the sofa.
James started and muttered, but did not regain consciousness.
Near the gate, near his bicycle, was a corner made by a shed.
And she went about for the rest of the day elusive and vague.
It came with a great storm of wind and rain and hail: a fury.
Alvina sat listless, musing, by the fire in the drawing-room.
He will want to rise, by you, and you will go down, with him.
â€œHe canâ€™t rise much because of me, can he?â€  â€œHow not?
Madame went into the drawing-room to smoke her sly cigarette.
Really, I donâ€™t know at allâ€”â€ Mr. May was most freezing.
But the question was, how much did â€œeverythingâ€ amount to?
â€œTell him what sort of a bag, Miss Houghton,â€ said Madame.
â€œTo say that you have so much money, and hope to have more.
So she fancies it.â€  â€œCan we pay her expenses?â€ said Max.
Alvina stooped and crouched under the right arm of Pacohuila.
I donâ€™t like â€™em cominâ€™ in anâ€™ goinâ€™ out, you know.
â€œIâ€™d better fetch some things, hadnâ€™t I?â€ said Alvina.
His remoteness, his southernness, something velvety and dark.
He laughed too, and picked up her bag as if it were a bubble.
Geoffrey was standing monumental between her and the company.
He opened his mouth slightly and lifted his head up and down.
Fortunately for them, Madame had seen to their table-manners.
In the bath-room he turned on the old-fashioned, silver taps.
She knew she would have to break her own trance of obstinacy.
Perhaps even something might be done about the cinematograph.
She felt she could not, she could not cut off every resource.
He took to the attentive study of his finger-nails once more.
Everything is under seal to be sold to pay off what is owing.
The house and the furniture and everything got to be sold up?
None the less, she also felt as if she had been knocked down.
To find a job, eh?â€  His cuteness startled her for a moment.
â€œWhat barrow-load of poison is that!â€ repeated the doctor.
She felt, if she knew where they were, she would fly to them.
I may be moved any day now.â€  â€œWellâ€”!â€ said the matron.
â€œOh, but so many things happen outside oneâ€™s imagination.
It might just as wellâ€”â€  Alvina would laugh and get tired.
Alvina was aware of nothingâ€”only of the presence of Ciccio.
Gleams, flashes, noises and then at last the frenzy of Paris.
His face was pale, he had that sombre, haunted, unhappy look.
She was thinking how she would be â€œmore comfortableâ€ here.
Then he disappeared, returning in a few moments with the ass.
Pancrazio returned with the lantern, and opened the big door.
There were two high white beds on opposite sides of the room.
She felt vaguely that Ciccio was miserable, and wondered why.
And then, screaming high in dialect, Maria would talk to her.
And she stood with her hand to her side, her face frightened.
She saw the snow-ridges flare with evening, beyond his cheek.
She sat and cried over the first she found: heaven knows why.
Death and eternity were settled down on her as she sat alone.
â€œIf you make up your mind to come back, you will come back.

Vossius echoes the same idea from the same rhetorical source.
In their relations with the men the women are extremely free.
The mention of the mutessarifâ€™s name awakened only a sneer.
Far from being an assistance, our zaptiehs proved a nuisance.
We were suddenly aroused by the rumbling of thunder below us.
We spent the following night in the German operatorâ€™s room.
Fortunately, no bones were broken, and the load was replaced.
Being without such protection we suffered both day and night.
Maize, wheat, and rice were growing, but rather low and thin.

The execution is a minor matter.â€  Chester looked thoughtful.
He told me he washed his hands of me.â€  Chester looked sober.
â€œHe must have the money about him,â€ suggested the minister.
â€œYes, Mr. Tripp.â€  â€œI canâ€™t understand it, for my part.
The distance by rail from Wyncombe to New York is fifty miles.
They went up two flights to the front room on the third floor.
And how do you like my quarters?â€  â€œThey are very pleasant.
â€œI will go in and introduce you.â€  They entered the office.
â€œNo.â€  â€œWhen will he be in?â€  â€œCanâ€™t say, I am sure.
You had better get intimate with him and offer him cigarettes.
Obviously the receipt belonged to James Long, who had lost it.
â€œI guess you are used to babies,â€ said the mother, pleased.
â€œI would, but I am to meet a friend uptown at six oâ€™clock.
Though well convinced of it, he wished to find out positively.
I should have seen them if he left them here.â€  â€œAll right.
He has tried two boys since, but doesnâ€™t seem to get suited.
But how did he happen to call on you?â€  â€œThere you have me.
He felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once.
He heard the question, and quickly comprehended the situation.
He wished this to be an agreeable surprise at some future day.
About six oâ€™clock one afternoon Chester knocked at his door.
My mother is naturally cautious, and would not give it to him.
â€œHow much is the fare to Tacoma from this point?â€ he asked.
Besides, he only says he did not see him after the boat upset.
It was clear that adversity had strengthened and improved him.
And yet, his curious refinement and enthusiasm bore them away.
But still he believed in his own excellence: and quite justly.
She brought in flowers and books, and, very rarely, a visitor.
Luckily, he sold one machine and even gained two pounds on it.
â€œWhat!â€ said a collier to his wife: â€œhave we got no coal?
He suggested that he and Alvina should marry before he sailed.
Alvina announced her intention of breaking off her engagement.
And having rapped it out, she prepared herself to stick to it.
â€œOh well, if she _does_â€”â€ said Miss Pinnegar cryptically.
They pinched her haunches and attacked her in unheard-of ways.
She was beaten by fate, as far as chastity and virginity went.
And in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy, shabby.
Why, in the name of all the free heavens, have human criteria?
â€œI canâ€™t see what it is to laugh at,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Thatâ€™s where he gets his ideasâ€”out of whiskeyâ€”or brandy!
This was the Withamsâ€™ new house, and Lottie was proud of it.
_Still_, she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority.
But some sort of _terror_ hunted her to the search of a lover.
His teeth were sound, but rather large and yellowish and flat.
These were his childrenâ€”most curious chips of the old block.
She liked taking a walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion.
â€œIt would do you good to get a bit of exercise out of doors.
He mounted the steps, still holding his bunch of white stocks.
He remained standing in the porch, staring at the closed door.
â€œWell,â€ said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered.
He annoyed her a little, by being completely oblivious of her.
And she, obedient, began to tie the bandage with numb fingers.
She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him.
â€œAnd is there need to understand the other?â€  â€œCertainly.
He would accept the ten pounds; but he would get his own back.
â€œDonâ€™t you want your dinner, Alvina?â€ she said at length.
They wanted to examine my private morals, for eugenic reasons.
â€œI hope youâ€™ll go further than _thinking_,â€ said Mr. May.
He sorted them in heaps, and marked the heaps in his own mind.
â€œHow did it go?â€  â€œI think it went very well,â€ she said.
I know they like them once theyâ€™re there, and they see them.
I can dance today.â€  â€œI donâ€™t think today,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou wonâ€™t have to dance,â€ said Geoffrey out of the bear.
I am practical impracticallyâ€”â€ she stumbled over the words.
Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.
But perhaps to you it is kind.â€  â€œThank you,â€ said Alvina.
There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.
â€œGeoffrey ought to know,â€ said Madame, looking at Geoffrey.
His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.
She heard Miss Pinnegarâ€™s scarcely audible step approaching.
I wouldnâ€™t think of it.â€ He turtled like an injured pigeon.
â€œWhat makes you feel so sure about it?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know.
He looked up, with a faint smile, from under his black lashes.
And will you hang your coat in the hall?â€ she said to Ciccio.
â€œAt any rate I know now,â€ she said, in rather a flat voice.
Ay, she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother.
â€œAnd if there is nothing, what do you intend?â€ said Madame.
Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.
But a hundred and twenty is better than a blow to the eye, eh?
â€œOld pasteâ€”old pasteâ€”antiqueâ€”â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Then she looked into Alvinaâ€™s eyes, really a little jealous.
â€œLâ€™allÃ©e italienne!â€ he said, and shouted with laughter.
Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.
Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.
Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.
So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.
And he seemed to throw her down and suffocate her like a wave.
It was not a warm morning, but there was a streak of sunshine.
Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.â€  â€œDonâ€™t say so!
Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.
â€œAnd where are the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras this week?â€ he asked.
She turned off the gas at the meter, and went upstairs to bed.
She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.
When she could lie still she turned away from him, still mute.
â€œI am staying with friends, here and there, for a few weeks.
â€œIâ€™m afraid there is nothing very pleasant, unfortunately.
In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.
I must go this afternoon.â€  â€œOn account of your engagement?
You know I mean what I say, Mrs. Larrickâ€â€”this to the wife.
â€œYou couldnâ€™t have anything more wholesome and nourishing.
More cumbers I sell, more graft for you, â€™cordinâ€™ to that.
He could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion.
He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.
â€œOh, it will be over in six weeks,â€ said the doctor easily.
Donâ€™t think about it.â€  He caught her hand and clung to it.
â€œI shall _never_ marry him.â€  â€œAh, never is a long while!
â€˜_O Richard, O mon roi!_â€™â€”â€  But the music had stopped.
Nothing will sing if youâ€™re there,â€ called the young woman.
Nurse!â€”â€ came the long call of Mrs. Tuke through the night.
Then she shuddered, and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief.
Do let me see him.â€  â€œDo you really want to?â€ said Alvina.
Ciccio shifted on his feet, watching Alvina pour out the port.
He turned immediately, with his cap in his hand, and followed.
â€œIf you have to be torn to pieces by forces, well, you have.
However, her monthâ€™s notice was up, so she was legally free.
He pointed to the harbour clockâ€”it was ten minutes past ten.
It was strange to feel the seethe of war and dread in the air.
She half pitied Alvina, and was more than half jealous of her.
So she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin.
â€œI couldnâ€™t get a cart to come down,â€ he said in English.
â€œThey are doing some washing,â€ said Pancrazio, explanatory.
In the distance was a darkness of bushes, along the far shore.
Pancrazio seized the leading rope angrily and turned upstream.
And then again they struck off to the right, under some trees.
It was difficultâ€”but the food was good, and the fire blazed.
There was room only for three on the settle before the hearth.
They loved her that she would strip maize-cobs or pick acorns.
Ciccio would have to take her to England again, or to America.
They were all talking, in the bright clear air of the morning.
â€œIf you are very long,â€ she said, â€œI shall go to England.
In the twilight he came to her, when she could hardly see him.
The Content of Classical Rhetoric Carried over into Logic   2.
To the Greeks and Romans rhetoric meant the theory of oratory.
In this sense the act of the poet may well be called creation.
It is concerned with the use both of the voice and of gesture.
Congruity (as pertaining more to grammar) he does not discuss.
Gascoigne and James attempted no more than manuals of prosody.
Consequently the Greeks   call this sort of thing allegory....
But he is nearer the truth who   calls all of these metaphors.
In a later book Boethius gives a clearer key to the objection.
They differed only because they used different kinds of proof.
The title page says it was written fyrst in Latin--by Erasmus.

What Tricks the young Baggages have to whet a manâ€™s Appetite?
--Well, come, Brother--many such things are done--  Sir _Feeb_.
Sir _Feeble_!--he would not, Sir, have usâ€™d me thus unkindly.
False Man, I do believe it, And I am satisfied you love me not.
But leave this fond discourse, and, if you must, Let us to Bed.

He saw Abel come out with some packages to carry to a customer.
â€œI thank you very much for your kind hospitality,â€ he began.
â€œWell, I have an idea,â€ answered Abel, in a mysterious tone.
As they passed Lord & Taylorâ€™s, a lady came out of the store.
â€œWhat?â€ queried the bookkeeper, evidently taken by surprise.
I suppose he found it and kept the money,â€ he added, bitterly.
The shriek comes, so the doctor tells us, from a nervous spasm.
She paused on the threshold, and her looks showed her surprise.
I am quite flattered at the opportunity of posing as a teacher.
â€œYes; he has just bought a new suit, a new hat and new shoes.
â€œIn about two weeks, Mr. Fairchild is going West on business.
It was really a diamond, and he had often found it serviceable.
He saw in it a proof of the friendly relations between the two.
Is Tiffanyâ€™s near here?â€  â€œYes, sir; only two blocks away.
â€œYe-es.â€  â€œHow did you know that I was coming to New York?
â€œI will only say that I am glad to meet you.â€  â€œThank you!
â€œYou are misinformed about my wanting to locate in this city.
When he was turned twenty-one I was worth ten thousand dollars.
Usually the bookkeeper did not show up till half an hour later.
But you havenâ€™t told me why you were â€˜bounced.â€™â€  â€œMr.
â€œGo after him!â€ he said, in a low voice, indicating Ralston.
He will be so angry with me.â€  â€œI think he will have reason.
â€œItâ€™s aâ€”lie!â€ exclaimed the gambler, but he turned pale.
â€œAre you sick?â€  â€œYes, sick at heart,â€ was the sad reply.
He attributed this to my influence over her, but it was not so.
â€œThatâ€™s whatâ€™s the matter with me,â€ rejoined Mr. Wilson.
Before he started from New York he called to see Mr. Fairchild.
That shows he is satisfied with you.â€  â€œI try to please him.
â€œâ€˜I shall not require your services any longer,â€™ he said.
She wants to ask you a few questions.â€  Floyd made a wry face.
â€œI hope I see you well, maâ€™am,â€ he said, bobbing his head.
â€œAbout three weeks,â€ answered Floyd, in an embarrassed tone.
I feel that I have done you injustice, and I want to repair it.
I have been assisted by a fortunate investment in outside lots.
What he failed to perceive was that the crowd hated excellence.
The whole morale of the house rested immediately on Miss Frost.
But still, the two unprotected ones must be sheltered from him.
He had desisted from â€œcreations.â€ Time now for a new flight.
He decided it was better to be a manufacturer than a tradesman.
He carried home a rough and pinkish brick, and gloated over it.
The square green emerald on her finger was almost non-sensical.
It was as if she found her busy contact with life a strain now.
Inwardly, Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from questioning.
She liked his fine, slim limbs, and his exaggerated generosity.
There was an inflexible fate within her, which shaped her ends.
Her own inscrutable nature was her fate: sore against her will.
And Alvina cried also: she did not quite know why or wherefore.
â€œIt takes his sort to make all sorts.â€ It took her sort too.
It would bubble and stir in them as earthquakes stir the earth.
In her silence her soul was alone with the soul of her darling.
And Alvina and Miss Pinnegar might move about and talk in vain.
And then he came out with the most original of all his schemes.
Heâ€™s out of his mindâ€”and itâ€™s drink; thatâ€™s what it is!
As soon as James came in to a meal, the two women attacked him.
She would pitch her dead negative will obstinately against him.
He knew he would have to sacrifice Miss Pinnegarâ€™s work-room.
Lottie Witham came to tea, and was shown over Manchester House.
She began to laugh nervously and hurriedly at the very thought.
â€œNo, itâ€™s not that!â€ hurriedly expostulated Miss Pinnegar.
â€œFather is in.â€  â€œYes, I donâ€™t mind,â€ he said, pleased.
â€œDo you think so?â€ he replied, again with the excited smile.
So she brought him a light, whilst he examined his broken shin.
â€œThat gives you what for,â€ he said, as if it were her fault.
At the bottom of the stairs Calladine, the caretaker, met them.
Now Mr. Mayâ€™s mind, though quick, was pedestrian, not winged.
â€œWith a monthâ€™s notice on either hand?â€ continued Mr. May.
â€œWhat can he have been doing?â€ said Alvina when he had gone.
And the things she said reminded Alvina so often of Miss Frost.
donâ€™t you think so?â€ And he rolled his eyes oddly to heaven.
But it merely meant that James was having the time of his life.
It was not till later in the evening that he relaxed this rule.
The film is only pictures, like pictures in the _Daily Mirror_.
The chemist was gone to Chapelâ€”he wouldnâ€™t open till eight.
Meanwhile Alvina took her plump white wrist and felt her pulse.
Alvina brushed out the long black hair, and plaited it lightly.
Mrs. Rollings is warming a blanketâ€”â€  Alvina ran downstairs.
He did not say a word, but held aloof as he walked with Alvina.
â€œYou are an Englishwoman, severe and materialist,â€ she said.
â€œCome!â€ said Madame, stretching out her plump jewelled hand.
â€œYou are better, dear Madame?â€ he said, smiling long at her.
The morning was faintly sunny, after the sleet and bad weather.
Ciccio springs forward and stabs the bear, then closes with it.
It was wonderful how well the men played their different parts.
â€œI do think you go on in the most unattractive way sometimes.
On the contrary, I think it is unkind for you also, this place.
â€œYou see I didnâ€™t care for the Woodhouse young men, either.
â€œExcuse my intruding on your mirth!â€ He looked archly round.
He flicked off the ash of his cigarette with his little finger.
His hand started, dropped the cigarette, but was not withdrawn.
â€œI say, Cicâ€™â€”â€ he said, â€œwhy did you change the scene?
Try.â€  â€œI know they are,â€ said Alvina, laughing confusedly.
She looked forward to his coming as to a visit from the troupe.
â€œIâ€™m all right, I tell you,â€ said James, his eyes flaring.
â€œYes,â€ she whispered involuntarily, soulless, like a victim.
â€œOh my dear, we shall be too muchâ€”â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Francesco Marascaâ€”Neapolitan.â€  â€œMarasca!â€ echoed Alvina.
There were substantial bills owing on account of the Endeavour.
That is too rich.â€  Max went off into a high and ribald laugh.
â€œIâ€™m afraid I shall never be particular enough,â€ she said.
â€œPlease donâ€™t come,â€ she said, turning at the street door.
She preferred his tawny eyes with their black brows and lashes.
And a good-humoured, half-mocking smile came over his face too.
And all the time he watched her curiously, from his large eyes.
â€œI didnâ€™t know thereâ€™d be two of you,â€ was her greeting.
â€œCiccio came to carry my bag.â€  â€œOh,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œYou are going to take a hand?â€  â€œCards on Sunday evening!
And you two are cycling back to the camp of KishwÃ©gin tonight?
She doesnâ€™t want a tame bear.â€ He smiled down on his friend.
â€œI will give you another pillow.â€  She led the way upstairs.
â€œPerhaps you would rather decide later.â€  â€œNo,â€ she said.
She knew her own position with the troupe would be humiliating.
She wanted to go away from them allâ€”from them allâ€”for ever.
Then she sent Max over to Mansfield, on some fictitious errand.
No doubt about it, the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were under suspicion.
â€œThere is the moneyâ€”soâ€”and soâ€”and soâ€”that is correct.
She had no serious acquaintance with anybody, she was too busy.
â€œYou look tired this morning,â€ he barked at her one hot day.
â€œMy business is whatâ€™s wrong with the stomach it goes into.
But there was no mistake, Dr. Mitchell was beginning to expand.
There was quite a stir in the town over the declaration of war.
He went into the matronâ€™s room, and asked for Nurse Houghton.
â€œBut put that aside,â€ he smiled again, a little dangerously.
It will be the proudest day of my life when I make you my wife.
Every one looked round, including the laden, tramping soldiers.
The matron had known Walter Pater, in the somewhat remote past.
His throbbing, muscular power seemed completely to envelop her.
â€œI understood one line,â€ said Effie, making big eyes at him.
â€œI shall have to go back to her.â€ And she held out her hand.
Youâ€™re just at the mercy of _Forces_,â€ she shrieked angrily.
â€œOh God, itâ€™s an accursed fugue!â€ cried the bemused Tommy.
There she sat, stranded in the dismalness, and knew no way out.
She waited a long time for the train from the north to come in.
Ciccio looked up and down for Pancrazio, but could not see him.
It was a little hole with an earthen floor and a smell of cats.
They came down to the level valley bed, and went rolling along.
She was lost to Woodhouse, to Lancaster, to Englandâ€”all lost.
These he placed on the seat of the settle in front of the fire.
There was a battered photograph of Lord Leighton, among others.
Two men stood below, amid the crumbling of finely falling snow.
â€œThey will come every day now, till Christmas,â€ said Ciccio.
â€˜Yes!â€™ I said, â€˜I will.â€™ So he tied me up on the cross.
There, in the level region, boys were snowballing and shouting.
â€˜Aidsâ€™ from the city of London are to be treated similarly.

It cheered him to think he was earning something, however small.
Butâ€”perhaps your parents might object.â€  â€œI have no father.
When he tendered the five-dollar bill Silas Tripp looked amazed.
He didnâ€™t pay you much wages, though.â€  â€œNo; he feels poor.
It will take all you can earn to pay your own way in a big city.
â€œYou are going to live in New York, arenâ€™t you?â€ asked Rob.
â€œYour future employer is Clement Fairchild,â€ said the artist.
Business men sometimes have a prejudice against outside workers.
A boy needs more pocket money now than he did fifteen years ago.
There seemed to be more books than Chester had ever seen before.
â€œYou ought to wear spectacles,â€ he said, â€œlike uncle Edgar.
Perhaps his friend the artist helps him.â€  â€œNo, he doesnâ€™t.
â€œCan I sell you a house this morning?â€  â€œWell, not exactly.
What sort of a boy is Felix?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know him very well.
Then you will earn more money from him.â€  â€œThank you, Arthur.
What would Silas Tripp say to that or his enemy, the bookkeeper.
â€œWhere do you wish me to work?â€ asked Chester, after a pause.
He lost no time in securing it and moving his few belongings in.
To us it is not important, as we have plenty of capital offered.
Perhaps heâ€™ll know of some cheap place where I can get dinner.
We can chat for an hour, and then go to dinner.â€  â€œThank you.
â€œWell, Mullins,â€ said the gambler, â€œI am getting impatient.
Better send Felix to the bank.â€  â€œBetter wait a little while.
I wouldnâ€™t have seen you suffer.â€  â€œI didnâ€™t like to ask.
He was feeling rather depressed when Chester came into his room.
â€œI ought to go out there, but you know how small my salary is.
â€œThat means a glass of whisky, doesnâ€™t it?â€ returned Floyd.
â€œI will not utterly ignore him.â€  â€œVery well, Mrs. Trimble.
She stepped into Silas Trippâ€™s store to buy a pound of butter.
The widder says sheâ€™s cominâ€™ back, but I donâ€™t believe it.
Between you and me, Mr. Tripp, I wonder that she stayed so long.
She developed heart disease, as a result of nervous repressions.
The white hair was not at all tragical: it was a family _trait_.
Meanwhile the shops began to take on a hopeless and frowsy look.
So that the superintendency of the Sunday School came to an end.
They could have bought a tie for four-three from James Houghton.
She seemed to laugh with a certain proud, sinister recklessness.
She wondered how he could have the slightest attraction for her.
She herself had come fully to believe that she did not love him.
â€œI donâ€™t want to go, dear,â€ said Alvina to the elder woman.
How she looked and looked at his dark, impertinent-seeming face.
But she had heard Alexander speak of Nurse This and Sister That.
Some little devil sat in her breast and kept her smiling archly.
Somewhat to her amazement, he sat steadily on for days and days.
Perhaps it acted like a tonic on the little devil in her breast.
Well, so she was, in the more-or-less exhausted part of herself.
She would be independent, she could laugh every one in the face.
Alvina had the old-fashioned wisdom to let be, and not to think.
Never had the common ugliness of Woodhouse seemed so entrancing.
It was to be fitted up as a sort of elegant lounging restaurant.
I havenâ€™t time, really.â€  â€œTime!â€ exclaimed Arthur rudely.
You neednâ€™t be afraid.â€  â€œBut Iâ€™m not afraid,â€ she said.
He drew a little nearer to her, and walked with a slight prance.
The idea is common to humanity, once youâ€™ve put it into words.
Thereâ€™s something missingâ€”â€ Again he looked towards Alvina.
I keep myself busy.â€  â€œWhat are your subjects?â€ asked James.
It was as if the pressure on her hand pressed her into oblivion.
â€œWe sâ€™ll have folks talking.â€  Suddenly she began to laugh.
â€œItâ€™s all off,â€ said Alvina, breaking into a nervous laugh.
She was thinking busily: but heaven knows what she was thinking.
Anyway it would be some sort of an adventure: better than a job.
There was something odd and integral about him, which she liked.
Im gesicht schon graue Flecken Ach, das muss im Spiegel stecken.
â€œAbout being able to buy it,â€ said Mr. May, a little testily.
She imagined herself dressing up with most priceless variations.
Miss Pinnegar was rather stiff with him and he did not like her.
On the Monday morning there was a rehearsal, Mr. May conducting.
But isnâ€™t it funny, they donâ€™t seem to want to come to them.
Every week she met a new set of starsâ€”three or four as a rule.
They had a most irritable professional vanity, and that was all.
He was about fifty years old, still handsome, and growing stout.
Now that she knew she was ill, Madame seemed to become more ill.
â€œBien sÃ»r, Madame.â€  â€œCiccio, a button off thy shirt-cuff.
It is there, in the silk bag.â€  â€œI will do it,â€ said Alvina.
They nodded with slow gravity, as if they were already _braves_.
He was flushed, erect, keen tempered and fierce and mountainous.
â€œNaples,â€ he said, looking down at her sideways, searchingly.
â€œWhat?â€  â€œThey say â€˜See Naples and die,â€™â€ she laughed.
I canâ€™t understand, myself, how people can go on liking shows.
Only poor Alvina lay back in her chair in a new weak convulsion.
Pigâ€™s-head, if that seems more suitable to you.â€  â€œTo whom?
â€œBut would he abandon you all without a word?â€ cried Mr. May.
â€œBastaâ€”had enough,â€ said Ciccio, with an invisible grimace.
â€œAre you getting ready to go?â€ she said, looking down at him.
His eye had wandered uncomfortably up to a portrait on the wall.
â€œI suppose theyâ€™re going this morning,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
But I doubt if itâ€™ll do any good.â€  â€œDo you?â€ said Alvina.
On Wednesday night there was another sensation at the Endeavour.
He took off his hat to Alvina, smiled slightly as he passed her.
Hein?â€  â€œYesâ€”certainlyâ€”if it matters,â€ said poor Alvina.
Sheâ€™s a bit like her father in the business lineâ€”all flukes.
Oh, she was too high and mighty before, and now itâ€™s too late.
Her big cousin sat opposite herâ€”how she disliked his presence.
But Ciccio, most uncomfortable in his four-wheeler, kept hidden.
She took a taxi to their theatre, and then on to their lodgings.
He took her hand, and looked at her along the glass as he drank.
â€œCome, daughter of the Tawaras,â€ said Madame brightly to her.
â€œWaste so much money?â€  Ciccio raised his shoulders slightly.
â€œI would like to see how it is, there, _chez elle_,â€ he said.
Eh?â€  He was smiling with a thick, doubtful, half sullen smile.
She loved it, she worshipped it, she defied all the other world.
Ciccio took off his coat and sat down in Mr. Houghtonâ€™s chair.
But still they were far too free and easy to suit Miss Pinnegar.
Alvina rose and went to the kitchen, the men trailing after her.
As they pumped up the tires, they heard some one padding behind.
Ciccio sat down almost like a husbandâ€”as if it were his right.
Let me show you a statement.â€  He rose and brought her a paper.
And yet she did not want to go to the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras either.
She wondered if she ought to appear before the board in uniform.
It put him in a black rage to have his great manliness insulted.
All fresh and juisty, all cheap and tastyâ€”!_â€ yelled the man.
Fresh cumbers!_â€ yelled the man,  Dr. Mitchell started his car.
He got in the habit of picking her up in his car, when he could.
When he was gone, the matron looked demure, and Alvina confused.
At once she went to look for Alvina, who had gone to her duties.
â€œWell, I _suppose_ it is all right,â€ said the matron gravely.
Following me round on his knees and shouting for me to love him!
I may be transferred for war service.â€  â€œThatâ€™s not likely.
Youâ€™re our only maternity nurseâ€”â€  And so the days went by.
The two men halted almost near the car, to watch the band go by.
Then Mrs. Tuke slowly reached for the rose-buds on the old wall.
He could hear the stifled cries and exclamations from Mrs. Tuke.
She would criticize him, find fault with him, the things he did.
The passengers glanced at them across the magic of estrangement.
Everywhere was crowded, the train was stuffy without being warm.
Alvina, thrilled by the southern country, was smiling excitedly.
Somewhere, she believed in the convulsion, the event elated her.
In the afternoon they were slipping down the Alps towards Turin.
He had built a house on the land left by Ciccioâ€™s grandfather.
Alvina was so tired she could hardly climb down to the platform.
Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow.
You will see how you like it.â€  She wondered at his uneasiness.
Ciccio sat on the settle beside her, and ate in large mouthfuls.
She felt his power and his warmth invade her and extinguish her.
Sometimes Alvina and Pancrazio were late returning with the ass.
He came straight towards her, smiling his slow, enigmatic smile.
â€˜Yes, you devil, but I shanâ€™t let you off,â€™ he said to me.
They went down, past the ruined houses broken by the earthquake.
She rose and went to the ruddy brazier, as if to warm her hands.
â€œYes,â€ he said, with a smile at the futility of the question.
â€œAnd I shall have to stay here?â€  He nodded, rather gloomily.
Her eyes, watching him, were vulnerable as if stricken to death.
But the night before he left she could bear the silence no more.
The third section of the book is mainly concerned with revision.
The poet has greater license in compounding and inventing words.
In _The Arcadian Rhetorike_ (1588), Abraham Fraunce treats both.
This is significant of a direct contact with classical rhetoric.
The audience is moved to action by the appeal to their feelings.
Ascham represents the advance guard in England against allegory.
Nay   I say if the style were changed the practise would profit.
In this division he provides for narrative, drama, and allegory.
The best classical treatments of style are to be found in Arist.

Our entry into Kirshehr was typical of our reception everywhere.
How could we tell where the places were until we had been there?
The road scenes in the interior provinces are but little varied.
They have no education whatever, and can neither read nor write.
Yet they are happy because they are contented, and have no envy.
In thoughtful mood we gazed around through the evening twilight.

We knocked and pounded, but a hollow echo was our only response.
By the time darkness fell the kibitka was filled to overflowing.
Even here we found that our reputation had extended from Kuldja.
Russian had served us in good stead, though not always directly.
The innkeeper and his friend now caught hold of the rear wheels.

â€œSo you donâ€™t know what he wants to see me about?â€ he asked.
â€œItâ€™s my money.â€  The bills were counted and all were there.
â€œThere is one objection, the precarious nature of the business.
â€œWhat is your cousinâ€™s name, Mr. Gardener?â€ asked the widow.
Do you often produce such sketches?â€  â€œI have just begun, sir.
â€œShall we say next Wednesday evening, at eight oâ€™clock sharp?
â€œI am Paul Perkins, of Minneapolis,â€ was the surprising reply.
Perkins says you are to come upstairs to his room,â€ he reported.
â€œJust as you say,â€ returned Dick Ralston, looking discomfited.
â€œI am aâ€”a capitalist, and sometimes speculate in real estate.
Gray, a wealthy banker, living on Forty-seventh Street.â€  â€œSo?
I canâ€™t decline a birthday gift.â€  â€œThatâ€™s what I thought.
You must spend the evening with me.â€  â€œI should like to do so.
He saw that his mother was easier in mind, and this relieved him.
Just one little glass.â€  â€œYou can put that off till afterward.
â€œI believe you wish to execute a will, Mrs. Trimble?â€ said he.
â€œIn the event of my sonâ€™s death,â€ interpolated Mrs. Trimble.
He may have reached one by swimming.â€  This was news to Trimble.
He wove one continual fantasy for himself, a fantasy of commerce.
His wife was left alone with her baby and the built-in furniture.
He fluffed out his silk-striped muslins, his India cotton-prints.
And besides, good sound stuff it was, no matter what the pattern.
The governess was a strong, generous woman, a musician by nature.
She could never get over her nervous apprehension of an invasion.
The women of Woodhouse came at last to _depend_ on Miss Pinnegar.
His shop, already only half its original size, was again too big.
He met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway.
But alasâ€”it is wearying to repeat the same thing over and over.
She felt him a terrible outsider, an inferior, to tell the truth.
â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina, still more archly and brightly.
Alvina declared her intention of departing to this training home.
A trained mid-wife.â€  â€œYes, of course,â€ said Alvina brightly.
But instead of being repelled and heartbroken, Alvina enjoyed it.
She swung her haunches and arched her eyes with the best of them.
And in a week she was as hard and callous to them as they to her.
He was a well-built fellow with sandy hair and a pugnacious face.
And now it seemed her face was a little too long, a little gaunt.
The old manner of intimacy persisted between her and her darling.
She never made you feel for an instant that she was one with you.
And sometimes they looked pathetic, with a mute, stricken appeal.
Do you sleep here by yourself?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Alvina laughing.
You can put a chain round its neck, and tie it up,â€ he retorted.
She wanted to summon her strength, to have her own back from him.
Donâ€™t you think you ought to thank me?â€  He recoiled a little.
â€œWhy should you mean anything by them!â€ He smiled down on her.
You pledge yourself to nothingâ€”you donâ€™t compromise yourself.
â€œI canâ€™t imagine,â€ said Alvina, laughing at the comic sight.
â€œI do wonder who he can be,â€ murmured Miss Pinnegar miserably.
Very nice man.â€  â€œRather short and dressed in grey?â€  â€œYes.
â€œAlvina can play as well as anybody in Woodhouse,â€ said James.
â€œSheâ€™s in London.â€  â€œWhy not speak of her?â€ asked Alvina.
He liked the _angel_, and particularly the angel-mother in woman.
She was extremely niceâ€”oh, much too nice with the female turns.
There was Jamesâ€™s face peeping inside the little ticket-window.
And all the time Miss Pinnegar sat like a sphinxâ€”like a sphinx.
A few bars of Toreadorâ€”and then Miss Poppyâ€™s sheets of music.
And Alvina, in her excitement, waited for Mr. May and her father.
In front of these, rows of slim halfpence, like an advance-guard.
He seemed for the time being contentedâ€”or nearly so, nearly so.
Itâ€™s all themselves to them, all the time.â€  He still puzzled.
Most of them had a streak of imagination, and most of them drank.
She felt he was smiling horribly all the time: lewd, unthinkable.
â€œOh, I donâ€™t think you should trouble to do that,â€ she said.
So they came under the light from the window of the sitting-room.
They were to obey Max, she said, for he was their eldest brother.
â€œBut nowâ€”you do,â€ he said, lurching round a corner with her.
Curious how _dark_ they seemed, with only a yellow ring of pupil.
He was looking right into her, beyond her usual self, impersonal.
In spite of herself she was shaken into a convulsion of laughter.
â€œA dirty Eyetalian,â€ said Max, in English, turning to Mr. May.
â€œThey were always good friends.â€  They all looked at Geoffrey.
In another country, they will not spend one sou if they can help.
He liked the Italian, but he never looked on him as a permanency.
How humble and remote she seemed, as across a chasm from the men.
It sank away out of her body, left her there powerless, soulless.
Câ€™est trop fort, voyez!â€ And she sniggered with fear and sobs.
Ciccio rose, threw his cigarette into the fire, and looked round.
It was covered with white wreaths and streamers of purple ribbon.
Ay, but nobody ever saw him, and it was off as soon as it was on.
â€œWhat there will be when everything is settled, I donâ€™t know.
If it was Max, who is sentimental, then no, the money is nothing.
Lâ€™allÃ©eâ€”â€  There came a great burst of laughter from Louis.
Is it the fairest on â€™em, the tallest.â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
â€œYou make it hard for _me_, in Woodhouse,â€ she said, hopeless.
She flushed, and hurried to show him his room, and the bath-room.
â€œEverything.â€  â€œReally!â€ Mr. May seemed smitten quite dumb.
â€œI feel as if the world had suddenly come to an end,â€ he said.
Ciccio returned shortly, and stood in the doorway looking at her.
Perhaps you might retain a lease of Miss Pinnegarâ€™s work-rooms.
If I only spend a pound a week, it costs fifty-two pounds a year.
What about you?â€  â€œOh, donâ€™t bother about me,â€ said Alvina.
He had a large practice among the poor, and was an energetic man.
But he still strained her fast, he had no idea of letting her go.
Which finger is it?â€ he asked, beginning to smile rather weakly.
â€œOh, but there isnâ€™t _one bit_ of me wants it, not _one bit_.
Alvina slept in her house these days, instead of at the hospital.
From the shadow of the high-road came the noise of the mandoline.
â€œYou must come!â€ came the voice in pain from the upper window.
It just does one in, and turns one into a sort of howling animal.
Iâ€™m howling with one sort of pain, heâ€™s howling with another.
â€œYouâ€™ve had some effect on him, thatâ€™s evident,â€ she said.
I donâ€™t want to be nailed together like a chair, with a hammer.
She looked up the places in the time-table, and decided on Leeds.
â€œGo back to the Tukes.â€ And she began again to brush her hair.
â€œWhy I want you?â€ He gave a curious laugh, almost of ridicule.
Was it atavism, this strange, sleep-like submission to his being?
She felt she could sink forever into his warm, pulsating embrace.
And then they hurried down the desolate platform in the darkness.
But we must leave the cart.â€  Ciccio asked questions in Italian.
The men in the room stared, but went on noisily with their cards.
Only there was a film of wood-smoke in the room, rather smarting.
Nothing could have been more marvellous than the winter twilight.
He seemed, in his silence, to _concentrate_ upon her so terribly.
What was to be done, then, on mornings that were dark with sleet?
Only sometimes the terrible influence of the place preyed on her.
â€œThey give so freely.â€  But Ciccio smiled a wry smile, silent.
â€œIâ€™m not sorry,â€ she answered slowly, using all her courage.
For quotations difficult of access I add the Latin in a footnote.
Aristotle's _Poetics_ discusses only epic and, especially, drama.
It included all of what to-day we might call working up the case.
Brunette Latini translated seventeen chapters of it into Italian.
The rhetorical character of these poetical models is significant.

Bacon was a scholar, but even more a philosopher and a statesman.
Meantime the wheels had been discovered by some passing neighbor.
In Bayazid we could not procure even proper wood for alpenstocks.
The lights in all the tents, save our own, were now extinguished.
Neither meat nor bread is ever eaten by any but the rich Kirghiz.
Our work of preparation was principally a process of elimination.
Official courtesy was now confined to despatches sent in advance.
Our rest at night was broken for the want of sufficient covering.
But just then his features changed, and he greeted us effusively.
â€œDo you have to buy offices in America?â€ was the last inquiry.
Oh, are you come--Your Hour was Twelve, and now â€˜tis almost Two.
Ay, but they are Sisters Children, and too near a-kin to be happy.
But, _Frank_, you do not know what a Wife I have provided for you.
I hope you will not call it Rudeness, Madam, if I refuse you here.
I have no quarrel to you, nor no man breathing, not I, by Fortune.
Ay, so methinks--but sheâ€™s kind, and will do reason for all him.
My Comfort is, I shall die with Grief, and not see the last of ye.
On 11 August, 1715, there was a revival at Lincolnâ€™s Inn Fields.

I care not who thou beest, but if a Man, Revenge me on _Alcander_.
Alas, I am his Wife; to disobey, My Fame as well as Duty I betray.

Sir- (or Save-) Reverence is an old and very common colloquialism.
â€œOho, thatâ€™s what youâ€™re after, is it?â€ said Silas, grimly.
He went about his work in a mechanical way, but neglected nothing.
â€œDo you ever contribute to these papers, Mr. Conrad?â€ he asked.
â€œYou have no property to dispose of by will?â€ asked the doctor.
The question arose, How would his mother get along in his absence?
â€œFour dollars, my dear madam!â€  â€œDo you consider it too much?
He ainâ€™t got no push, and heâ€™s allus forgettinâ€™ his errands.
My youngest son asked me the other day to draw a cow on the slate.
He sat on a high stool, but he was only reading the morning paper.
Will he be in soon?â€  â€œPerhaps he will, and perhaps he wonâ€™t.
â€œBut that would be a mean thing to do,â€ said Chester, startled.
I made the promise, and I mean to keep it,â€ said Chester, firmly.
â€œI will tell you, sir,â€ said the bookkeeper, with an ugly look.
Chester must have chanced upon the receipt and carried it to Long.
On one side was a desk, at which Prof. Hazlitt himself was seated.
â€œBorrow a little money from the office,â€ answered Dick, coolly.
Before relating what followed, a word of explanation is necessary.
I was born up Albany way, and came here when I was about your age.
He is going to Washington.â€  David Mullins was glad to hear this.
When he had gone, Ralston said, â€œWho is that, Mullins?â€  â€œMr.
He did not care to have him speak so freely before the office boy.
He entered the office and glanced about, expecting to see Chester.
And I am to have twenty-five dollars forâ€”â€”â€  â€œYour trouble.
â€œIn the neighborhood of fifty dollars,â€ answered the conductor.
â€œAs well as I ever expect to be,â€ answered Mrs. Trimble, sadly.
â€œOne year would be sufficient, it seems to me,â€ put in Trimble.
Floyd looked up in surprise, but did not comprehend the situation.
Yes.â€  â€œWell, Chesterâ€™s bought it.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t mean it!
He rummaged in the empty lofts, and among the discarded machinery.
James Houghton cried, and put a black band on his Sunday silk hat.
All seemed straightforwardâ€”not _very_ cordial, but sufficiently.
She wanted to cry, and fling herself on the breast of her darling.
The mighty question arises upon us, what is oneâ€™s own real self?
They were luminous and crystalline, like the eyes of a changeling.
If he could have overcome her he would have been mad to marry her.
For a little while Alvina flaunted about in her nurseâ€™s uniform.
After all, it was not for her to reconstruct her parentsâ€™ lives.
The roof and the timbered sides of the way seemed to press on you.
He seemed to linger near her as if he knewâ€”as if he knewâ€”what?
And the young man had hung round, and had never wanted to go away.
Alvina followed them persistently, but a little aloof, and silent.
She was completely indifferent to sight-seeing and scouring about.
She kept on wondering what she should do if he wanted to kiss her.
Every man has his own special feelings, and his own right to them.
Witham was here till ten minutes ago.â€  â€œYes,â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œHow do you explain such behaviour?â€ said her father pettishly.
He sat looking at it absorbedly, bent over it in the candle-light.
Have you got a handkerchief?â€  â€œItâ€™s in my jacket,â€ he said.
Every individual should, by nature, have his extraordinary points.
In the background were two booths covered up with coloured canvas.
The negro was thin, and looked young but rather frail, and limped.
He looked at himself sideways, and feared dismally he was thinner.
I wonder what it can be.â€  â€œI havenâ€™t an idea,â€ said Alvina.
And she gave a queer, sharp little rap on the table with her hand.
â€œI told you I had bought a cinematograph building,â€ said James.
â€œShe isnâ€™t indispensable.â€  And Alvina was to play the piano!
All the Dream Waltzes and Maidenâ€™s Prayers, and the awful songs.
But he was very happy sitting chatting tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Alvina.
Miss Poppyâ€™s professional virginity was thus saved from outrage.
They hate to admire anything that they canâ€™t take to themselves.
â€œMy young men drink a little beer, after their horrible journey.
Well, then when shall I dance?â€  Alvina turned and looked at her.
They are dead.â€  â€œAnd you wander about the worldâ€”â€ she said.
They had all disappeared over the brow of Lumley Hill, descending.
In the wintry twilight the crowd began, lingeringly, to turn away.
Why are they?â€  â€œI suppose they canâ€™t help it,â€ said Alvina.
â€œDonâ€™tâ€”!â€ she cried, lifting her hand to stop his progress.
These fellows from the south, they are half children, half animal.
He departed on his nine mile ride through the rain to Knarborough.
It might have spoiled everything if Madame wasnâ€™t such a genius.
From which?â€  â€œDonâ€™t give me anything, please,â€ said Alvina.
Then he swung round the bicycle, and stood it again on its wheels.
â€œIf _thatâ€™s_ what youâ€™ve seen in him!â€â€”there was a pause.
â€œMa-rÃ -sca!â€ She shook her head at the taste of the syllables.
Poor thing, left aloneâ€”and hardly a penny to bless herself with.
But he felt it in his flesh, the harshness and discomfort of them.
Alvina had a post-card from Madame, from Cheshire: rather far off.
â€œCiccio didnâ€™t come to see you, hein?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
â€œAnother four thousand francs there,â€ she said, nodding sagely.
Well, â€™s a strappinâ€™ anuff feller, for them as goes that road.
If she could have imagined how far he was from any such intention.
But he confronted her like a powerful ox, full of dangerous force.
Miss Pinnegar expected Alvina, but by the train, which came later.
Iâ€™ve lived here all my life and seen everything bad happen here.
â€œWell I think itâ€™s been a most agreeable game,â€ said Mr. May.
â€œNot many more times here, eh?â€ he said, smiling significantly.
He doesnâ€™t want to see _me_.â€  â€œWell, if you donâ€™t want to.
He can never have left things so bad.â€  â€œCiccio,â€ said Alvina.
Miss Pinnegar could answer her own fate according to its question.
And she guarded her money, and watched for some other opportunity.
But soon she realized that they loved itâ€”particularly the women.
Yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor, they had to submit.
None the less the women had their complaints against Dr. Mitchell.
Heâ€™s got the biggest understandinâ€™s of any man iâ€™ Lancaster.
Sometimes he was given a good hitâ€”though nearly always by a man.
Alvina glanced at her, flushed crimson and looked down to the man.
â€œWhatâ€™s this?â€ cried Mrs. Tuke, cocking her head on one side.
He slowly relaxed his clasp, and she slid down like rain to earth.
Well, despair was no good, and being miserable was no good either.
She wrote out a telegram, that she would be at Leeds that evening.
â€œI canâ€™t, I think,â€ she said abstractedly, looking up at him.
For her it was so potent it made her tremble when she noticed him.
The depth of his warm, mindless, enveloping love was immeasurable.
The train seemed to rush ponderously, massively, across the Weald.
Nobody asked her anythingâ€”she might have been Ciccioâ€™s shadow.
She listened to the chatter of French and Italian in the corridor.
Near ChambÃ©ry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car.
Ciccio became excited as they neared Modane, the frontier station.
And Alvina settled her cushion, and slept more or less till Genoa.
Vecchio!â€ nodding violently and indicating that she should drink.
The group with the lantern moved again upstream, becoming smaller.
â€œI had better go upstairs and take my things off,â€ said Alvina.
â€˜Youâ€™ve said youâ€™d do it, so now you must,â€™ he said to me.
They were the one-storey dwellings commanded after the earthquake.
The lovely, pristine morning of the world, before our epoch began.
He shall do this without destruction or damage to men or property.
The imitation of Plutarch was far narrower than that of Aristotle.
It is a text-book of rhetoric which was used in the Roman schools.
The epic is like a palace and so requires more space than a drama.
This he does in his famous differentiation of rhetoric and poetic.
The Stoics of our day affirm that the only wise   man is the poet.
From the beginning the learning of the Church was of pagan origin.
Before we reached the _khan_, or inn, we were obliged to dismount.
A Turk believes that all water is purified after running six feet.

But here on the desert we could buy nothing but very coarse flour.
In its present condition the Great Wall belongs to various epochs.
At several points along the route we were delayed on this account.
One whiff, and the pipe was taken away to be emptied and refilled.
Finally we were obliged to admit that sometimes such was the case.
In conclusion we thanked the viceroy for the honor he had done us.

â€œIâ€™m goinâ€™ to work in your place Monday morninâ€™,â€ he said.
â€œHas Mr. Tripp spoken to you?â€ asked Chester, his heart sinking.
When Monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted.
â€œHow long have you been drawing?â€  â€œEver since I can remember.
Even his mother thought of it only as a pleasant diversion for him.
He is my uncle.â€  â€œYour uncle!â€ exclaimed Chester, in surprise.
I suppose you understand!â€  â€œYou sold it?â€  â€œNo, I pawned it.
They thought the other might refer to a ring or some small article.
â€œHowâ€™s your mother this morninâ€™, Chester?â€ asked the grocer.
â€œI donâ€™t care to sell, Mr. Tripp,â€ said Mrs. Rand, decisively.
â€œI came here by way of Pittsburg,â€ answered the tramp, coughing.
â€œHow did he know about my store?â€ demanded Silas, incredulously.
â€œI donâ€™t see how I can spare you, Chester,â€ she said, soberly.
An hour glided by rapidly, and then a step was heard on the stairs.
His name is Chester.â€  Chester was amazed at the sight of the boy.
â€œI shall be glad to pay you any attentions,â€ insinuated Ralston.
New Yorkâ€™s a right smart place, I admit, but give me Minneapolis.
He knew now that he would be able to support himself and more, too.
Are you trying to get a place?â€  â€œNo.â€  Felix looked surprised.
I am Mr. Mullins, his bookkeeper, and represent him.â€  â€œJust so!
He did not seem strong, and there was a sad expression on his face.
â€œIf he were alive he would let us know,â€ he said, after a pause.

To seehim peel and prepare an apple for her was an exquisite sight.
Miss Frost, hearing this legend, looked sideways at the enthusiast.
What money she made went chiefly to support the Houghton household.
There are such poles of opposition between honesties and loyalties.
The shop seemed to have digested some of its indigestible contents.
Some of her regular customers paid her a shilling a weekâ€”or less.
â€œWeâ€™re more than friends.â€  â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ she said.
And then, most irritating, a complete _volte face_ in her feelings.
â€œBecause you donâ€™t understand what it means,â€ said her father.
I canâ€™t understand it.â€  â€œCanâ€™t you?â€ said Alvina brightly.
Purity and high-mindednessâ€”the beautiful, but unbearable tyranny.
His strength was so different from hersâ€”quick, muscular, lambent.
For well-to-do mothers she would charge from three to five guineas.
Her greatest horror was lest her husband should come into the room.
In these days Mrs. Houghton never talkedâ€”unless to fret a little.
So Alvina refrained from pondering on her motherâ€™s life and fate.
And perhaps neither of them knew that the intimacy itself had gone.
â€œIt wonâ€™t be done for nothing,â€ he said, looking at her again.
And Miss Pinnegar and I canâ€™t have anything to do with it anyway.
Alvina was asked back to teaâ€”on Wednesday afternoon, closing day.
The mere incongruity of such a desire on his part formed a problem.
I canâ€™t stand him.â€  â€œWhy?â€”suddenlyâ€”â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Between her and the Woodhouse Withams there was a decided coldness.
â€œThere is no need to make provision for me,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
He brushed his crisp, curly brown hair carefully before the mirror.
â€œOf course we can _delay_ for some time, until I get my supplies.
â€œWell, I donâ€™t see how I can do it under twenty pounds a month.
So they watched like cats for their manâ€™s return, at dinner-time.
â€œTheyâ€™ve stopped again,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, recalling Alvina.
how awful it was!â€  â€œWhy?â€  â€œThere was no pleasing the woman.
And when do you expect the fittingsâ€”?â€  â€œTomorrow.â€  â€œWhat!
She watched the ladies making upâ€”she gave some slight assistance.
The place was crowded with a whooping, whistling, excited audience.
But his naÃ¯vetÃ© roused the serpentâ€™s tooth of her bitter irony.
He had dreamed of crowded houses every night, and of raised prices.
But there was no probability of his being able to raise his prices.
Pictures donâ€™t have any life except in the people who watch them.
At that moment she would cheerfully have gone along with the navvy.
Since opening the Pleasure Palace James was less regular at Chapel.
While the interview was going on, Mr. May arrived, full of concern.
Iâ€™ll be KishwÃ©gin.â€ And he bridled and beamed self-consciously.
Louis arose, a _brave_ like Ciccio, in war-paint even more hideous.
The othersâ€”they are nothingâ€”what they are Madame has made them.
Ciccio turned round and looked at them with a sneer along his nose.
You say _love_â€”â€ He raised his shoulders slightly, with a shrug.
For him, it was not yet quite natural to express himself in speech.
â€œBut if Naples is so lovely, how could you leave it?â€ she asked.
He looked at her, and made a slight, sad gesture, indifferent also.
Ciccio was just a fantasy blown in on the wind, to blow away again.
â€œThey are the darkest of all.â€ And she shook her head roguishly.
â€œOh, good morning, Mrs. Rollings!â€ they heard Mr. Mayâ€™s voice.
Thy temper is a devilâ€™s, which maybe is worse than an animalâ€™s.
â€œWonâ€™t you come?â€ she said, smiling and looking into his eyes.
â€œWonâ€™t you?â€ she said, as she stood with her back to the door.
She wanted to meet his eye, to have an open understanding with him.
The boy was sent for the cab, James swallowed a spoonful of brandy.
Right in her bowels she felt itâ€”the terrible, unbearable feeling.
I donâ€™t fancy he would have wanted such people following, myself.
On the next morning she dressed herself carefully in her new dress.
In the first place, you are English, and he thinks to rise by that.
But Madameâ€™s shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off.
And her crying started Miss Pinnegar, who cried almost as bitterly.
But not very much, Iâ€™m sure of that.â€  â€œHow much do you think?
The young men thrust their glasses up towards Alvina, in a cluster.
â€œThe leather is not good in these things of Gigiâ€™s,â€ she said.
â€œYou think itâ€™s strange?â€ he said, showing his teeth slightly.
Salute me, my own friend.â€  And Ciccio kissed him on either cheek.
He threw bedclothes over her and went downstairs, whistling softly.
You are not leaving Woodhouse for ever.â€  â€œGood-bye!â€ she said.
I never thought I should live to see the day,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Your money isnâ€™t with his, is it?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
She allowed her to pay for her room, and the expense of travelling.
For some weeks she found nothing, though she wrote several letters.
The attendant women threw up their hands and looked at one another.
The doctor began by being rather lordly and condescending with her.
â€œItâ€™s you I _am_ thinking about,â€ she laughed, flirting still.
And she knew well how hateful material circumstances can make life.
She put down her name on the list of volunteers for active service.
Thereâ€™s nothing at all to prevent your getting engaged to me now.
Where is your mandoline?â€  He turned round and looked up the road.
Even the will of God is a life-force.â€  â€œYou donâ€™t understand!
â€œYou come, Allaye,â€ he said softly, with his foreign intonation.
After all, he had triumphed over his well-to-do, Anglicized cousin.
Giuseppe had insisted that Ciccio should take second-class tickets.
They sat and ate the food they had brought, and drank wine and tea.
Alvina became almost comatose, in the burning heat of the carriage.
They were out on the platform again, they had secured their places.
The world is an amazing place.â€  This thought dozed her off again.
With a growl and a rush it swooped up the first loop of the ascent.
It was a wide, strange bed of dry boulders, pallid under the stars.
She was almost stupefied with weariness and the cold, bruising air.
And Alvina had struck one of them, here on the edge of the Abruzzi.
And yet in the whole market-place she was aware of nothing but him.
Alvina hated their Cockney accent and florid showy vulgar presence.
The second was a letter, a real insulting letter from Dr. Mitchell.
Ciccio was still turning talking in the rapid way to his neighbour.
â€œIf Italy goes to war, you will have to join up?â€ she asked him.
But there was a great, twin-towered church, wonderful from outside.
â€œBecause I love youâ€”â€  She crouched quite still on the hearth.

He worked with a will, and in twenty-five minutes the work was done.
As to its bringing him in money, the idea had never occurred to him.
â€œDo you think I shall pull through, doctor?â€ asked the young man.
â€œYes,â€ was the unexpected answer, â€œbut I shall not make a will.
â€œI have no doubt you can do it, for it will not require an expert.
â€œThatâ€™s cousin Herbert,â€ said Rob, and he ran to open the door.
Yet he could not help enjoying the walk, so perfect was the weather.
â€œWhen do you think Jimmy will get well?â€ asked the agent, kindly.
Shure, I told this gentleman that youâ€™d make it all right with me.
Why didnâ€™t I get the place?â€  â€œYou must ask Mr. Fairchild that.
Chester took notice of the way in order that he might know it again.
He looked with surprise at Chester, not immediately recognizing him.
Youâ€™ve been a good friend to James Long, and he wonâ€™t forget it.
He will bear watching.â€  â€œI wish he were more like Mr. Fairchild.
They had two-dollar seats, and I learned that Chester paid for them.
I am contented to make ten dollars a day.â€  â€œSo should I be, sir.
â€œYou might prove a dangerous rival.â€  â€œYou neednâ€™t be afraid.
Did you have the toothache?â€™â€  Chester burst into a hearty laugh.
If my old father were living, I would give half the money I possess.
â€œYouâ€™ll have to settle up soon,â€ said Ralston, in a surly tone.
â€œWhat complaint does Mr. Fairchild make of you?â€  â€œNone at all.
I keep a store out in Wyncombe, and he was in my employ most a year.

But from the first she had a curious ascendancy over James Houghton.
In came the architect, with whom he had played many a game of chess.
Miss Frost was straightforward, good-humoured, and a little earnest.
When she was twenty-three years old, Alvina met a man called Graham.
He contrived to meet Alvina in the evening, to take a walk with her.
â€œYes we are,â€ he insisted, trying to put his arm round her waist.
Her father said:  â€œWell, of course, youâ€™ll do as you think best.
â€œOf course you donâ€™t mean it, dear,â€ said Miss Frost, quailing.
Or rather, being sufficiently a woman, she didnâ€™t decide anything.
And now, in her floridity, they were bright and arch and light-grey.
It was time for that perfected flower to be gathered to immortality.
So the young need not be so proud of their superiority over the old.
Miss Frost wept also for herself, for her own sorrow and slow death.
Oh, itâ€™s easy workinâ€™â€”you donâ€™t have to knock your guts out.
Permit the name of Houghton to disappear from the list of tradesmen?
â€œWe can go into that later,â€ said James, leading off the plumber.
Picture her disappointment when she found Albert quite unattractive.
Iâ€™ve got to be in at nine.â€  â€œWhich way shall we go?â€ he said.
â€œThe light is fading.â€  Alvina came in with the flowers in a jar.
It seemed as if his words came off him without affecting him at all.
â€œI suppose the old connections count for something.â€  â€œThey do.
â€œAs sure as all that, are you!â€ he said, with a sneering grimace.
â€œBecause thereâ€™s no need to understand it,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
None the less, as Christmas drew near Alvina worked up her feelings.
He was becoming really depressed by his failure to find any opening.
But he must perforce keep enough in hand for a ticket to Birmingham.
He fluttered like a boy, he fluttered as if he had just grown wings.
But this cheerfulness and brisk perkiness was a great strain on him.
Wellâ€”â€ said James vaguely, nervously, giving a glance at Mr. May.
â€œAnd youâ€™ll just retire, and live quietly,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œDonâ€™t you think heâ€™s dreadful?â€ said the poor elderly woman.
â€œCome down, come down!â€ hissed Mr. May frantically from in front.
On the whole, Alvina enjoyed the cinema and the life it brought her.
She was curious to see what Madame and her four young men were like.
Then quick as lightning both turned their attention again to Madame.
â€œCome and put in the flowers,â€ said Mr. May anxiously, to Alvina.
Awful things men were, savage, cruel, underneath their civilization.
â€œDo you think I could confuse you in my dislike of this Woodhouse?
â€œThey are all ve-ry kind, and ve-ry practical with their kindness.
And soâ€”in ten yearsâ€™ timeâ€”no more KishwÃ©gin at all.â€  â€œNo.
What does he understand, Max, dear brother, what does he understand?
Her face was very white under her spotted veil, her eyes very black.
â€œI should love to be one of the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras,â€ said Alvina.
How submissive she was, with an eternity of inaccessible submission.
I must find you something else.â€  â€œPlease donâ€™t,â€ said Alvina.
HÃ©?â€  â€œThank you _so_ much,â€ said Alvina, holding out her hand.
â€œI enjoy itâ€”and so does father.â€  â€œNo,â€ cried Miss Pinnegar.
â€œDidnâ€™t I say so!â€ said Miss Pinnegar, starting from her chair.
How would you like him then?â€  â€œHe isnâ€™t, is he?â€ said Alvina.
For once, every eye was upon her, every mind was thinking about her.
Sheâ€™ll have to go out of Manchester Houseâ€”her and Miss Pinnegar.
â€œShe wants you to get in with her.â€  He looked round at the cabs.
Ciccio, smiling slightly, and keeping his head ducked, took the key.
She smiled at him in a quick, luminous smile, a magic change in her.
He sat looking at her with an instant re-establishment of knowledge.
He turned aside his face, as if unwilling to give a straight answer.
â€œI find the house, but I couldnâ€™t find no door,â€ said Geoffrey.
A stray cat darted from the scullery, and broke a plate in her leap.
Good-bye!â€  â€œYouâ€™re looking well, Alvina,â€ people said to her.
â€œBut I donâ€™t want to come to Woodhouse unless it _is_ necessary.
Slowly she climbed the familiar hillâ€”slowlyâ€”and rather bitterly.
She would not endure one single hint of contumely from any one else.
And as the weather was decent, everybody was in a real holiday mood.
In her moments of sullen rebellion she thought of Natcha-Kee-Tawara.
He smiled excitedly and meaningful at her, and came a little nearer.
â€œIâ€™d rather not be engaged, under the circumstances,â€ she said.
What does he look like, really?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina.
â€œHave some more!â€ said Effie, watching over the top of her glass.
He was the one victor, arching stealthily over the vanquished north.
There was a terrible encumbrance of packages and luggage everywhere.
Geoffrey sobbed, and the tears came silently down Ciccioâ€™s cheeks.
Then he turned and looked with haunted eyes into the eyes of Alvina.
They were to stay in the house of his uncle, his motherâ€™s brother.
And he sat for the most part impassive and abstract as a Red Indian.
Are you cold?â€ came a loud, raucous, American-Italian female voice.
And then they took a difficult, rocky track ascending between banks.
He pushed his chair among the litter of fire-kindling, and sat down.
He put fresh faggots behind the fireâ€”though Pancrazio forbade him.
There was nothing to do with the water but throw it out of the door.
She felt transfigured in it, clairvoyant in another mystery of life.
â€œWe will make a fire-place in the other bedroom,â€ said Pancrazio.
Ciccio must take her to America, or Englandâ€”to America preferably.
All down the oak-dry bankside they burned their great exposed stars.
Meanwhile the declaration of war drew nearer, and became inevitable.
And when she got into the kitchen, she forgot what she had come for.
â€œBe damned to them all.â€ She heard unspeakable pain in his voice.

He lost no time in presenting himself at the office of _The Phoenix_.
â€œOffered to send his mother five dollars a week!â€ he soliloquized.
â€œI suppose you are boarding here,â€ he said, with a little sarcasm.
He thrust his hand wildly into his pocket, and looked panic-stricken.
â€œWell,â€ said the bookkeeper, â€œwhatâ€™s the matter?â€  â€œMatter?
â€œYes, sir.â€  â€œI congratulate you heartily,â€ said Mr. Fairchild.
â€œI have lost my place.â€  â€œWhen was that?â€  â€œThree days since.
Perhaps you will come, too, Edward?â€  Edward Granger shook his head.
I am sorry to be a burden to you, but it will     only be for a year.
Remember your promise.â€  At this moment Mr. Dean entered the office.

James had accumulated sixpences, and made a little space in his shop.
The coal improved a little in quality: it was cheap and it was handy.
Her voice was like her fatherâ€™s, flexible and curiously attractive.
It is, really.â€  There was an odd clang, like a taunt, in her voice.
She had two hundred pounds of her own, bequeathed by her grandfather.
If it had not been that with him there was no question of succumbing.
There seemed a great deal to put in order after her motherâ€™s death.
James had had such large ideas of setting up house, in the beginning.
But as yet, at this period, the idea was in abeyance, it did not act.
He had auburn hair, high colouring, and a rather challenging bearing.
Mr. Houghton came to father about the building alterations yesterday.
I think itâ€™s an awful outlook for you.â€  â€œDo you?â€ said Alvina.
Perhaps because of his â€œcloseness,â€ and his secret determinedness.
They were having nothing to do with such desperate nereids as Alvina.
He hurried into his coat and gathered his tools, anxious to get away.
â€œI never knowed â€™em come down wiâ€™ me.â€  â€œYou ought to, then.
â€œIâ€™m glad youâ€™ve come,â€ said Alvina, as Miss Pinnegar entered.
Her eyes were dilated and arched with a mocking, almost satanic look.
After Christmas, however, she had nothing at all to think forward to.
â€œHow very _fortunate_ for us.â€  â€œProperly handled,â€ said James.
â€œIâ€™m afraid that makes it useless for my purpose,â€ said Mr. May.
â€œFatherâ€™s got something going,â€ said Alvina, in a warning voice.
I pity your mother.â€  â€œOh, but he was always alike,â€ said Alvina.
And then all kinds of comic and incongruous tunes came into her head.
She followed me to the kitchen in a _fury_ while I cooked for myself.
She felt bewildered, a little excited, and as if she was not herself.
They seem to like the programs.â€  â€œI think they do,â€ said Alvina.
And pictures donâ€™t have any feelings apart from their own feelings.
Youâ€™re not as up to the mark as they are.â€  â€œNot up to the mark?
The four young men had risen, and stood looking at Alvina and Madame.
Elle pourrait aussi Ãªtre belle, sâ€™il y avait un peu plus de chair.
â€œItâ€™s all right,â€ said Alvina, as she looked at the thermometer.
The _brave_ Louis, hearing a sound, starts up with his bow and arrow.
Louis swings round, and at the same moment the bear strikes him down.
Why donâ€™t you marry?â€  â€œNobody wants to marry me,â€ said Alvina.
They all at once covered their smiles and pulled themselves together.
Geoffrey shrugged his shoulders, and would not give his comrade away.
Together we will go to Knarborough and bring back the naughty Ciccio.
â€œAh!â€ she cried suddenly in French, â€œthe ungrateful, the animal!
She watched both Ciccio and Alvina with her black, inscrutable looks.
Shall she not?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Ciccio, unwilling to commit himself.
But Ciccio and Geoffrey had already packed up the property, and left.
If it doesnâ€™t rain, the young men will cycleâ€”perhaps all of them.
You donâ€™t want anything from Natcha-Kee-Tawara, or from KishwÃ©gin?
It was wrong to begin it.â€  â€œBut why?â€ insisted Alvina, laughing.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter.â€  He murmured something, but was incoherent.
â€œYou think there will be much to come to Miss Houghton?â€ she said.
Then she went on with her cousin to her cab, home to the funeral tea.
She cashed all the money she could: a hundred-and-twenty-five pounds.
Nor do I, nor do I.â€  â€œCan I help with the darning?â€ said Alvina.
There was Madame spinning her web like a plump prolific black spider.
Madame had Max and Louis by her side, Alvina had Ciccio and Geoffrey.
Ciccio had let go her hand, and was wiping his lips with his fingers.
â€œBring me everything youâ€™ve gotâ€”every _thing_ that is valuable.
â€œI would like to see it, there.â€  â€œAsk _her_,â€ repeated Ciccio.
â€œI canâ€™t think why you bring _him_ here,â€ snapped Miss Pinnegar.
I used to think sometimes there was something wrong with your mother.
Especially as I see those tempting piles of pennies and haâ€™pennies.
But unfortunately, when Mr. May returned, a corkscrew was in request.
Alvina was sitting sunk in thought and torpor after her sudden anger.
Some hurried inquisitively across to speak to her and look at Ciccio.
And for ten years, look at it, itâ€™s five hundred and twenty pounds.
Alvina knew it was useless to be either angry or otherwise emotional.
If summoned, she would have to go before the medical board on Monday.
But undoubtedly the nursing life, arduous as it was, suited her best.
It happened he was in a workmanâ€™s house when the man was at dinner.
â€œDonâ€™t you think Dr. Mitchell is quite coming out?â€ said Alvina.
A very praiseworthy work, I am sure.â€ She looked wickedly at Alvina.
â€œPerhaps you _are_ only just beginning your _own_ life,â€ she said.
She was not thinking, so she took no particular notice of the speech.
â€œI was only talking like a child, from the imagination,â€ she said.
â€œBut Iâ€™ve never thought about it,â€ she said, rapidly cogitating.
And now the engagement is announcedâ€”â€  He looked at her anxiously.
Do you think itâ€™s a serenade?â€”â€ And she lifted her brows archly.
â€œTo make a man howl outside there like that, because youâ€™re here.
â€œOf courseâ€”â€ Mrs. Tuke watched Alvina with big, dark, slow eyes.
She asked for a week-end, to make some arrangements for her marriage.
You ask me another, eh?â€  She was silent, sitting looking downwards.
But his hands, with the soft, powerful clasp, only closed her faster.

No, astounding as it may seem, there was no return of such a creature.
Soft and supple as she was, her backbone never yielded for an instant.
He too touched her and kissed her: and did _not_ rouse her to contest.
And as she left it off she lost her bounce, her colour, and her flesh.
Here she was, with a bang, planked upon the shelf among the old maids.
He spoke in a slightly mouthing way, not well bred in spite of Oxford.
Who ever would have believed she would have been taking tea with them.
â€œYes,â€ said Albert, beaming down at her from his strange pale eyes.
He wore very low, turn-down starched collars that showed all his neck.
And feeling in a false position, she took his arm, rather unwillingly.
â€œI think itâ€™s very good.â€  â€œWhatâ€™s very good?â€ asked Alvina.
Now I wonder why self-consciousness should hinder a man in his action?
â€œShow Mr. Witham out through the shop, Alvina,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
And by good luck, when he called one evening in the week, she was out.
He was a tall thin man with a black moustacheâ€”about fifty years old.
This was in the first months after she had given Albert his dismissal.
He was at Oxford againâ€”would not return to Woodhouse till Christmas.
And it was then she seemed to shrink: she seemed positively to shrink.
His soft collar, immaculately fresh, had a dark stripe like his shirt.
â€œI was taking a look at this old erection, with a view to buying it.
And now James, in his cheap little cap, was smiling a formal farewell.
But he still bent unknowing over his plate and gobbled his Irish stew.
She went valiantly round to the front entrance, and climbed the steps.
Feel that, for fairly well!â€ said Mr. May, handing the bag to Alvina.
â€œI _canâ€™t_ believe people are like that!â€”sane people!â€ he said.
Mr. May usually took rooms for the artistes in a house down in Lumley.
â€œNormal.â€  â€œNormal!â€ re-echoed Madameâ€™s rather guttural voice.
Women shrieked as Ciccio, in his war-paint, wheeled near the pavement.
Somewhere the sun was setting, and far overhead was a flush of orange.
â€œI call that too much!â€ Miss Pinnegar was crying, thoroughly upset.
Geoffrey stared with his big, dark-blue eyes stolidly at the newcomer.
It was a dummy knife, but it was a heavy blowâ€”the dog of an Italian.
The two men leaned to each other and kissed farewell, on either cheek.
â€œYes, and when we are no longer young, there is not so much to wear.
â€œCome upstairs, Miss Houghton!â€ called Madameâ€™s voice from above.
â€œWe will go in this way,â€ she said, suddenly opening the hall door.
Monday passed, and Ciccio did not come: Tuesday passed: and Wednesday.
The two women went out to meet the cab-man, who had James in his arms.
At half-past seven she arose, and started the business of the new day.
Here he turned, lingeringly, to her, and she lingered in front of him.
And so she went downstairs, to that horrible cousin of her fatherâ€™s.
Madame looked round like a bird, examining the room and the furniture.
Her black veil, pushed up, sagged over her brows like a mourning band.
He is a man of the people, a boatman, a labourer, an artistâ€™s model.
Alvina shivered as she stood on the bleak hillside, by the open grave.
Now she would have given anything to see the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras again.
Louis was tender, Geoffrey round-eyed and inquisitive, Ciccio furtive.
â€œBravaâ€”Brava!â€ cried the others, when Madame sank into her place.
But the spell was on her, of his darkness and unfathomed handsomeness.
â€œOh, yoâ€™n made yer bed then, hanâ€™ yer!â€  â€œYes,â€ said Alvina.
You donâ€™t take a drop oâ€™ nothink, do yer?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
All right, giâ€™e â€™s ha â€™efcrown today, anâ€™ tâ€™other termorrer.
She brought all to Madame, and Madame fingered the treasures lovingly.
And she was with him, on his side, outside the pale of her own people.
I hate it.â€  â€œWhy?â€ he said, with a curious, sarcastic intonation.
He made a gesture with his head and shoulders, evasive, non-committal.
â€œBut hasnâ€™t your world often come to an end before?â€ said Alvina.
â€œI canâ€™t be the bride of all four of you,â€ said Alvina, laughing.
â€œPacohuila and Walgatchka are blood-brothers, two bodies, one blood.
Ciccio came down, in his shirt-sleeves as usual, but wearing a collar.
She lingered over her possessions: what to take, and what not to take.
He sat down and scrutinized her sharply, officially, before beginning.
There were her graves: her motherâ€™s, Miss Frostâ€™s, her fatherâ€™s.
But every individual has his own, or her own fate, and her own sphinx.
Do I owe anything?â€  â€œI donâ€™t think you do,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.

His face was red and clean-shaven, his eyes blue, his teeth very good.
The men did not like Dr. Mitchell, and would not have him if possible.
Heâ€™d jump down my throat with both feet afore Iâ€™d opened my mouth.
But luckily she felt she knew her work at least as well as he knew it.
And she talked him over, with quiet, delicate malice, with the matron.
From his imperious condescension he took to a tone of uneasy equality.
The hateful problem of material circumstance would be solved for ever.
But he would kiss herâ€”and against that she obstinately set her will.
In this northern town Alvina found that her individuality really told.
â€œWonâ€™t you play again?â€ she called into the night, to the unseen.
A manâ€™s figure was seen hovering outside the gate, on the high-road.
â€œCanâ€™t you stand my presence!â€ he shouted, and dashed downstairs.
She had run away from both menâ€”from Ciccio as well as from Mitchell.
She saw Effieâ€™s long, outstretched arm of repudiation and weariness.
You come with me, to my place in the mountains, to my uncleâ€™s house.
â€œThe sun!â€ said Ciccio, nodding towards the orb and smiling to her.
Ciccio took his hat from his tear-stained face and put it on his head.
She watched spell-bound: spell-bound by the magic of the world itself.
But she saw the golden dawn, a golden sun coming out of level country.
She could not understand why he seemed upset and in a sort of despair.
Giovanni touched his hat to Alvina, and gave the lantern to Pancrazio.
They could hear the click of the ass and the ejaculations of Giovanni.
Giocomo puts water in the wine which he sells to the people who go by.
But once, when he was doing a pictureâ€”I donâ€™t know if you know it?
Nice morning.â€  â€œDoes everybody speak English here?â€ asked Alvina.
The village itself was old, dark, in perpetual shadow of the mountain.
She turned with thankfulness to the magenta anemones that were so gay.
Indeed her chief teacher, at first, was a young fellow called Bussolo.
And he seemed always anxious to prove that he had been so good to her.
Ciccioâ€™s group was called up for the following week, as he had said.

â€œSo you came with your valet?â€ she said, as Ciccio stood with the bag.
Yes?â€ He put his hand on her, and she started as if she had been struck.

Dick Ralston was in the real estate office when the telegram was received.

Madame too had her avaricious side, and was glad to get back the slippers.

So they watched each other, as strangers across a wide, abstract distance.
No, I canâ€™t.â€  She lifted her veil, kissed Alvina, and dabbed her eyes.
Why will you?â€  â€œI suppose because I like him,â€ said Alvina, flushing.

The coffin had been carried down and laid in the small sitting-roomâ€”Mrs.
Youâ€™d have thought theyâ€™d have buried Miss Frost beside Mrs. Houghton.
And now she seemed to see them from a great distance, out of her darkness.

She was tired after her day: too tired to trouble about anything any more.

â€œWhy do you always say you canâ€™t?â€  â€œBecause I canâ€™t,â€ she said.

â€œWhat have you to say to me?â€  She looked up at him with confused eyes.

In the family of three brothers there was oneâ€”not black sheep, but white.
Lottie told Alvina all about him, and Alvina was quite excited to meet him.

Miss Pinnegar stood for some moments in pure oblivion in the shop entrance.
When she recovered, she felt she was on the brink of hysteria and collapse.

CHAPTER X THE FALL OF MANCHESTER HOUSE   Alvina rose chastened and wistful.
The odd arch of his eyebrows made him suddenly seem not quite human to her.

I heard youâ€™d come, Miss Houghton, so I _hastened_ to pay my compliments.
â€œI hope not.â€  â€œThank you for the _hope_â€ said Mr. May sarcastically.
Why separate, hein?â€”frÃ¨re?â€  Geoffrey again clasped Ciccio in his arms.

Sir, be this Evening at the Door, Donna _Clara_ has something to say to you.
I beg your pardon, Sir, if it be so, poor Mortals can but grieve in silence.
What happy Man couâ€™d claim a title in thee, And trust thee to such danger?
I see your Cuckold might have a life good enough if he couâ€™d be contented.
What, the Frolick is to go round, I see, you Women have a happy time onâ€™t.
Most mighty Emperor, a Messenger from _Cadiz_ has Letters for your Highness.
Ay, Madam, his very Coach at last was turned into a Jewel for your Ladyship.
Very well, very well, now the Posset; and then--ods bobs, and then--  _Dia_.
Not young nor handsom, for then Vanity had made her glory to have been seen.
Why, know you then who did it?--Oh, how Iâ€™d be revengâ€™d upon the Rascal!
Oh, a very thriving Calling, Sir,--and I have a young Wife to practise with.
â€˜Twas most unmanly, Sir, and they deserve it--I wonder that they come not.
Dâ€™ye think my Devil of so little Quality, to suffer an Affront unrevenged?
But, Sir, I will for once allow your Friend the Captain to keep you company.

Faustus_ (4to 1697), but produced a decade earlier, probably November, 1685.
You have your Lessons, stand to it bravely, and the Townâ€™s our own, Madam.
To my Knowledge, Sir; for what a Man of Honour relates, I may safely affirm.
I will chastise thy vulgar Ignorance, that yclepes a Philosopher a Conjurer.
It must be so, for how shouâ€™d either of these know I expected that Honour?
1724 reads â€˜before we go to him to-morrow.â€™  p. 229, l. 27 _his Safety_.
Dick obviously does not remain on the stage as his entrance is marked later.
Generally, to nick (slang), means â€˜to arrestâ€™, â€˜to waylay and stopâ€™.
It must be allowed that Mrs. Behn bears away the palm in this witty passage.
The two 4tos, 1687 and 1688, and the 1711 edition all read â€™.arpsicalsâ€™.
Silas Tripp was weighing out some sugar for a customer when Chester entered.
Mrs. Rand was as much amazed as Chester himself at his success as an artist.
I worked for him once.â€  â€œHow did you like it?â€  â€œIt almost killed me.
â€œWas this handkerchief found in the store?â€ asked Mrs. Rand, in surprise.
Indeed, I am proud of you now.â€  â€œI can hardly realize it myself, mother.
â€œIâ€”I am looking at this sketch,â€ answered Chester, in slight confusion.
â€œI donâ€™t know him very well, but I believe he does a very good business.
In ten minutes a heavy step was heard on the stairs, and James Long entered.
What of him?â€  â€œIt is our bookkeeper, David Mullins.â€  â€œIs it, indeed?
He felt that Mr. Fairchild ought to know it, but he shrank from telling him.
This, to be sure, took all his salary, but he was earning something outside.
He did not wish needlessly to prejudice his employer against the bookkeeper.
â€œHello, Mullins, old boy!â€ said Dick, pushing forward with extended hand.
This, so far as he knew, was the first visit made by Ralston to Mr. Mullins.
â€œThe Fifth Avenue sets a good table.â€  â€œMy appetite is sure to be good.
â€œNo, I think not.â€  â€œWonâ€™t you introduce me to your friend?â€  â€œMr.
Now he is disposed of.â€  â€œI see you are shrewd,â€ said Chester, laughing.
â€œYes, Iâ€™m a little foxy when thereâ€™s occasion,â€ rejoined Mr. Perkins.
He was the owner of a large building, of which Mr. Fairchild acted as agent.
â€œI canâ€™t say, but it wouldnâ€™t have been policy to make you acquainted.
Another chance gone, Mullins.â€  The bookkeeper looked warningly at Ralston.
â€œI see you are practical and understand what we want, Mr. Rand,â€ he said.
â€œI took nothing of value,â€ continued Ralston, â€œand you canâ€™t hold me.
I may be able to     earn something by sewing, but it will be only a little.
â€œMy boy,â€ he said, â€œI shall not soon forget your kindness to my father.
Women folks is mighty onsartin when they make promises.â€  Mrs. Rand smiled.
He could sell these at a handsome profit, but will hold them a while longer.
The Foundationâ€™s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64â€“6221541.
Between the grip and the homely idiom no boy could endure without squealing.
Men flocked inâ€”even women, buying their husbands a sixpence-halfpenny tie.
Miss Frostâ€™s voice was clear and straight as a bell-note, open as the day.
Sufficient that the girl herself worshipped Miss Frost: or believed she did.
It is truly incredible how Alvina became blooming and bouncing at this time.
She was always ready with her hard, nurseâ€™s laugh and her nurseâ€™s quips.
In her calm periods she lay stupid and indifferentâ€”or she cursed a little.
Human functions were too obviously established to make any great fuss about.
The battle-spirit was really roused in him, and he heartily liked the woman.
He also played with herâ€”being a doctor, and she a nurse who encouraged it.
And that was rather irritating to the well-to-do and florid daughter of W.H.
Whatever the fate of the mother, the fate of the daughter will be otherwise.
She began to hate outspokenness and direct speaking-forth of the whole mind.
Their walk was heavy-footed and slurring, their bearing stiff and grotesque.
The miners, the iron-workers, those who fashion the stuff of the underworld.
He was a little insolent and condescending to the natives, who disliked him.
She knew that her darling carried away a portion of her own soul into death.
Alvina seemed to keep strangely calm and aloof all the days after the death.
Dark, empty-feeling, it seemed all the time like a house just before a sale.
But it needs a certain natural gift to become a loose woman or a prostitute.
In midsummer Albert Witham came to Woodhouse, and Alvina was invited to tea.
When will you have your first lesson?â€  â€œOh,â€ cried Alvina in confusion.
I think Iâ€™m self-conscious, but I donâ€™t think I have so many misgivings.
â€œWhatâ€™s the matter is that he feels guilty for not knowing his own mind.
And there, through the uncurtained window, she saw him sitting awaiting her.
Itâ€™s all done, but fixing.â€  â€œHadnâ€™t you better leave it,â€ she said.
When she lay in bed, she stared at the light of the street-lamp on the wall.
More even than she rebelled against the Withams did she rebel against a job.
â€œâ€™Tisnâ€™t fair time, is it?â€  â€œNo, itâ€™s no fair,â€ said the woman.
He missed his eleven oâ€™clock whiskey terriblyâ€”terriblyâ€”his pick-me-up!
â€œHadnâ€™t we better make it monthly?â€  The two men looked at one another.
The two men were having a few more excited words, their voices just audible.
In Spooney-ooney Island Why surely there ought to beâ€”â€   Poor Miss Frost!
She stuck to her black blouse and black shirt, and her simple hair-dressing.
When rather drunk, he talked charmingly and amusinglyâ€”oh, most charmingly.
Max went over and shook Geoffrey, Louis put his hand on Ciccioâ€™s shoulder.
Come to me.â€  Alvina went slowly to Madame, and took the outstretched hand.
Ciccio made no pretence of listening, but smoked and stared at his own feet.
Mr. Houghton nodded slowly and gravely, as if to give his measured approval.
Itâ€™s interesting in a way, just to show what savage Red-Indians were like.
Geoffrey hurriedly lit his lamp and swung off in the dark back to Woodhouse.
And then they tramped the dreary, hideous streets of the manufacturing town.
Hectored by women all my lifeâ€”hectored by womenâ€”first one, then another.
Arenâ€™t you coming down to speak to your cousin?â€  â€œSoon,â€ said Alvina.
Even I, I donâ€™t know himâ€”no, though he has been with me for three years.
â€œShall we go down?â€  Alvina did not go into the drawing-room with Madame.
In chapel she cried, thinking of her mother, and Miss Frost, and her father.
Yet the sense of the unknown beauty of him weighed her down like some force.
And Mr. May strutted out of the room like a bird bursting with its own rage.
â€œI shall see you soon,â€ he said, smiling sheepishly and bowing to Alvina.
A change does you good.â€  â€œIt does, doesnâ€™t it,â€ said Alvina brightly.
Shall I give it back, hein?â€  â€œI gave it to you,â€ said Alvina, offended.
He smiled and smirked and became oddly self-conscious: rather uncomfortable.
Doesnâ€™t it disturb you?â€ came the manâ€™s voice from the moonlight below.
â€œDo you think I might?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know,â€ said Alvina, non-committal.
He smiled, a fine, subtle smile, like a demonâ€™s, but inexpressibly gentle.
And he was reaching forward to her as a snake reaches, nor could she recoil.
The women and children kissed Alvina, saying:  â€œYouâ€™ll be all right, eh?
Men looked at her, officials stared at her, soldiers made remarks about her.
It screamed all the nightâ€”all the way from Paris to ChambÃ©ry it screamed.
The vast world was in one of its convulsions, and she was moving amongst it.
Pancrazio took the lantern and went to examine the load, hitching the ropes.
A great flat loaf fell out, and rolled away, and smack came a little valise.
Alvina ventured down the steep descent, Pancrazio following showing a light.
â€œI am so hungry.â€  â€œYou had better keep your coat on,â€ said Pancrazio.
The gods who had demanded human sacrifice were quite right, immutably right.
Pancrazio, Ciccio, Giovanni, Maria and a mason all set about the fire-place.
â€œBut I should have thought that would make them less generous,â€ she said.
River-banks that have been enclosed in our reign shall be treated similarly.
To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.
To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.
No person in the play should be made to do or say anything out of character.
The political life of western Europe centered in the camp, not in the forum.
Quintilian, like Aristotle, believes in the persuasive efficacy of examples.
The teaching is the appeal to the intellect of the hearer by means of proof.
It is impossible, however, for a person ignorant of logic to be a true poet.
Philosophy, oratory, and poetry have thus one end--and only one--persuasion.
Raisins here, as well as in many other parts of the country, are very cheap.
From the numerous flocks around it, we took it to be a shepherdsâ€™ village.
Those of the rural districts, however, are not so shy as their city cousins.
But this was no proof against a surprise in the case of the noiseless wheel.
Little Ararat is the meeting-point, or corner-stone, of three great empires.
They both strongly recommended the northwestern slope as being more gradual.
As we emerged into the streets an Armenian professor gravely shook his head.
It required our united efforts to lift them out, and half carry them across.
Here the thermometer registered 39Â° Fahrenheit, and was constantly falling.
The camp was reached at 4 P. M., just twelve hours from the time we left it.
Gathering up the remaining baggage, we hurried away to continue the descent.
By the gradually rising ground, and the rocks, we knew we were off the road.
Here the only physician was an old blind woman of the faith-cure persuasion.
Here, most of the caravans would put up during the day, and travel at night.
For some miles we pushed along on the bare axle inverted in the pedal-crank.
A round table is the only one that can be used in an aristocratic household.
â€œWill you telegraph to your parents from Shanghai your safe arrival there?
Upon him rests the decision in nearly all the great questions of the empire.
There is no record of its performance, and the actorsâ€™ names are not given.
Wouâ€™dst thou praise Heaven for thy Being, Without that grateful part of it?
I could not get from _Friendlove_--Thou hast not told _Celinda_ of my coming?
I will do any thing to save that Life, To which my own so nearly is allyâ€™d.
â€˜Shaw, Sir, â€˜tis nothing, a Man wouâ€™d doâ€™t for Exercise in a Morning.
Ay, marry, Sir, that were a Match indeed, she being your Uncleâ€™s only Heir.
By Fortune, the Rogueâ€™s looking for me; he has a Challenge in his hand too.
Then â€˜twas not by Merit, Sir--But how shall I know you are either of these?
I believe this is the Bed-chamber Window where the Bride and Bridegroom lies.
--Sir, shall I send for a Scrivener to draw the Settlement you promisâ€™d me?
Ay, _Sharp_, we are bound to labour in our Callings, but mum-- here he comes.
the blessed Youth, to whom She has given her Vows?--Live, and enjoy, _Diana_!
Let us no longer doubt, the Powâ€™rs above Will be propitious to united Love.
Iâ€™ll trust my Life, my Honour and my Mistress in so good hands at any time.
But possibly his mind may alter upon the Arrival of this False Count of ours?
And is it pure and tender Love for my Person, And not for my glorious Titles?
Since youâ€™ve lost your Honour with your wits, Iâ€™ll try what mine will do.
Ay, Sir, that is to make me an absolute Viscountess--we cannot stay--farewel.
Dear Brother,    _According to your desire I have sent for my Son from   _St.
Omerâ€™s_ Spark, that I may present my self as soon as they come from Church.
He, Madam, whom I waked--and seeing me, Heavens, what Confusion seizâ€™d him!
Racking me up to a starving Want and Misery, Then took advantages to ruin me.
Noble Mr. _Wasteall_--                      [_Salutes him, so does_ Bearjest.
Sir, I have many Reasons to believe, It is my Fortune you pursue, not Person.
How, the Ghostly--hush--have a care--for â€˜twas the Ghost of _Bellmour_--Oh!
Justice, Sir, Justice--I have been cheated--abused--assassinated and ravisht!
In _The Forced Marriage_ she seems to have remembered _The Maidâ€™s Tragedy_.

Then thou art happy; but if _Erminia_ fail, I shall not live to reproach her.
--Sir, lay the Interest of a Father by, And give me leave this Lover to deny.
Where got you courage to admit his Love, Before the King or I did it approve?
Am I the mask to hide your Blushes in, I the contented Fool to veil your Sin?
Your Sister is a Saint whom I adore; But I refuse a Life that comes from you.
Isilliaâ€™s_ Beauty can supply that want; _Falatius_, what dâ€™ye say toâ€™t?
Ay, Sir, what Virtues or what Merits can accomplish me for that great Honour?
_Enter_ Bellemante, _with a Candle in one Hand,     and a Book in the other_.
Charmante _peeps out--and by degrees comes all out,     listning every step_.
Ay, Sir, did you not go out of Town last night, to your Brother the Advocate?
Methought I entertainâ€™d a Demi-God, one of the gay Inhabitants of the Moon.
--How this agrees with what the learned Cabalist informâ€™d me of last Night!
Or hast thou from _Snow Hill_     The assistance of some ballad-making quill?
â€œI must tell mother and see what she thinks about it,â€ he said to himself.
â€œIâ€™d rather work anywhere else for two dollars,â€ said Chester, bitterly.
What is your address?â€  â€œNumber one ninety-nine West Thirty-fourth Street.
â€œYou have a hard cough, Mr. Bruce,â€ said Mrs. Rand, in a tone of sympathy.
We are not doing very well, as you may imagine.â€  â€œSo I surmised, maâ€™am.
â€œWell, say five dollars a month.â€  â€œAbout sixteen or seventeen per cent.
â€œHow much will you give me if I board at home, Mr. Dexter?â€ asked Chester.
But I didnâ€™t take it.â€  â€œGo for the constable, Abel, and mind you hurry.
Did you really design it?â€  â€œYes, sir.â€  â€œI suppose you got pay for it.
Why, I am forty-five, and I havenâ€™t a particle of talent in that direction.
There is one comfort, and that is that you are not wholly dependent upon him.
â€œWho is he?â€  â€œHe is going to work here,â€ returned Mr. Conrad, sharply.
â€œErnest,â€ said Arthur, in a soothing tone, â€œI have brought you a friend.
All feeling of repugnance, all thoughts of the boyâ€™s malady were forgotten.
Iâ€™d like to know who it is that knows so much about my plans.â€  â€œI will.
Probably you would not find me in.â€  Mr. Perkins was a tolerably shrewd man.
But this is not good work.â€  â€œSir!â€  â€œMy dear sir, donâ€™t be offended.
â€œI shall be glad to be your guide if you wish to see something of New York.
Perhaps,â€ said Mullins, nervously, â€œwe had better give up the whole thing.
Did the paying teller look suspicious when you presented the check?â€  â€œNo.
You might have thought me mean.â€  â€œPoor fellow!â€ said Chester, pityingly.
â€œDo you want me to take you with me, mother?â€ asked Chester, with a smile.
â€œI never thought the country was so large before,â€ said Chester to Edward.
â€œI have just arrived from New York.â€  The broker regarded him in surprise.
I suspect you are better fitted for business than most young men of your age.
â€œDidnâ€™t my friend Floyd see him drowned?â€  â€œHe may have been mistaken.
â€œWhom have you selected for that office?â€  â€œWill you serve?â€ she asked.
I made a mistake in marrying Mr. Trimble, but it is too late to correct that.
â€œAny news, Mrs. Greene?â€ he asked, as he handed her the package of butter.
The two would stay together in the parlour, laughing and talking by the hour.
Miss Frost gave a slight gesture with her right hand, of helpless impatience.
She had never thought of being a nurseâ€”the idea had never entered her head.
How many infernos deeper than Miss Frost could ever know, did she not travel?
They cocked their eyes at her, when she was not looking, and wondered at her.
She would not intrigue into marriage, or try and make use of them in any way.
Useless to talk of the distracted anguish of Alvina during the next two days.
â€œFatherâ€™s sure it wonâ€™t payâ€”and it will cost I donâ€™t know how much.
Arthur Witham, the plumber, came in with James Houghton to examine the house.
â€œMake it as dear as you can, for father,â€ said Alvina, laughing nervously.
But, we must repeat, it was as if the glass wall of an aquarium divided them.
Come down to the Coach Road tomorrow afternoon, and let me give you a lesson.
You agree to a number of rules and conventions and laws, for social purposes.
â€œIâ€™m very much obliged.â€  â€œYou ought to be more than that,â€ she said.
I have no doubt a little _later_â€”if we need itâ€”I can find a few hundreds.
And wages in particularâ€”â€  â€œBut surely Miss Houghton will have her wage.
We donâ€™t get on at _all_ well, she and I.â€  â€œWhat a pity,â€ said Alvina.
All it gave _me_ was gas in the stomach.â€  â€œSo overbearing!â€ said Alvina.
He was up at half-past five in the morning, and by seven was well on his way.
In spite of herself, in spite of outraged shame and decency, she was excited.
But thatâ€™s where youâ€™re different from them.â€  â€œBut _am_ I?â€  â€œYes.
Spring went on to summer, and then there was a very shadowy margin of profit.
It was so different from Woodhouse, where everything was priced and ticketed.
â€œWe are drawn from three races, though only Ciccio is not of our mountains.
Why is it horrible?â€  Alvina quickly undressed the plump, trim little woman.
â€œYou know I think itâ€™s quite wonderful, your scene,â€ she said to Ciccio.
â€œNot without Madame,â€ he said, with the slow, half-sneering, stupid smile.
You can get to know everything about peopleâ€™s actual lives from the cinema.
There!â€  â€œAnd they donâ€™t want to appreciate and to feel?â€ said Mr. May.
Madame would not come near the theatre when she herself was not to be acting.
All were in ordinary dress, but without coats, acting in their shirt-sleeves.
In Knarborough, I donâ€™t know.â€  â€œHow much money had he?â€ asked Mr. May.
But he would do it.â€  â€œAnd what point would he make for?â€  â€œWhat point?
But they will remember.â€  Geoffrey rode swiftly as possible through the mud.
He looked up at her steadily, on his guard, from under his long black lashes.
She wondered why he wore the nail of his little finger so long, so very long.
â€œOh well then, in that caseâ€”â€ But he was filled with dismay and chagrin.
Yes?â€”Yes?â€ he said, in a voice that seemed like a palpable contact on her.
â€œI should like that.â€  â€œYes, it is niceâ€”but you donâ€™t know the life.
Why, when he was at Oxford, you know, learning for his head masterâ€™s place.
Next day she dashed back almost to Woodhouse, and swerved round to Sheffield.
â€œThat he should tell me if he should like to marry you alsoâ€”quite simply.
Shall she be our pianist?â€  The eyes of the four young men rested on Alvina.
â€œAnd the diamonds are real?â€ said Madame, making Alvina hold up her hands.
With a strange determined flourish he filled his glass, cocking up his elbow.
It was utterly dark, and she knew he smiled, and she began to get hysterical.
The young men were at table, talking as young men do, not very interestingly.
Really, she had come down in the world, conforming to such standards of life.
Alvina was startled by the deep, mysterious look in his dark-fringed ox-eyes.
â€œNa, Allaye,â€ he said, â€œtell me something.â€  â€œWhat?â€ laughed Alvina.
â€œI wish you would.â€  â€œGood,â€ he said, a broad smile on his thick mouth.
Only his little modern education made money and independence an _idÃ©e fixe_.
And Iâ€™m _sure_ Miss Houghton would rather be unlucky in cards than in love.
â€œ_I_ know youâ€™ll come out all right in love, _I_ know,â€ he said heavily.
Two minutes afterwards they were startled by the irruption of the work-girls.
â€œHave we any money in hand?â€  â€œThere is about twenty pounds in the bank.
â€œBut what have our personal morals got to do with them?â€ said Max angrily.
Shall you come back to us, then?â€  â€œI will if you likeâ€”â€  â€œIf I like!
A young gardener was workingâ€”and a convalescent slowly trailed a few paces.
He was leaning forward to her, smiling, self-conscious, tentative, and eager.
â€œMatron!â€ said Dr. Mitchell, with a return of his old mouthing importance.
â€œAnd are you going to marry him?â€ asked Mrs. Tuke, with a long, cool look.
She felt herself like one of the old sacred prostitutes: a sacred prostitute.
â€œIâ€™ve waited for you since five oâ€™clock, and Iâ€™ve got to go back now.
His eye lit up again, he pulled himself together for the entrance into Italy.
She saw a tram-car, far out from everywhere, running up to cross the railway.
Pancrazio broke into a flood of dialect to Giovanni, handing him the lantern.
She seemed to glow with a delicate light for him, there beyond all the women.
When Pancrazio was carrying up stone or lime on the ass, she accompanied him.
And yet their red-purple silkiness had something pre-world about it, at last.
The golden rethoryke is good refeccion   And to the reader ryght consolation.
Herodotus in verse would remain a historian; but no prose work can be poetry.
The characteristic structure and movement of poetry is not considered at all.
The last kind of proof is derived from logic; the first two, from psychology.
Both, he says with Aristotle, have an affinity in this wordish consideration.
English rimes receive half of this space, and classical meters the remainder.
Invention comprises illustration on the one hand and ... fables on the other.
For often under a fayre fayned fable   A trouthe appereth gretely profitable.
The poets feign these fables, of course, to lead the readers out of mischief.
For these the object-lesson of renaissance failure should serve as a warning.
On nearing Angora itself, we raced at high speed over the undulating plateau.
This, of course, is very hard on the poor man who has to work during the day.
Under the shadow of these gloomy walls was enacted a tragedy of this century.
Thus far we had been journeying through Russian territory without a passport.
The men never walk; if there is any leading to be done it falls to the women.

â€œIt strikes me the kid has come to no harm from being discharged,â€ he said.
Mr. Fairchild has telegraphed that he will be at home sometime during the day.
Have you had supper, Felix?â€  â€œNo.â€  â€œThen come and take supper with me.

The young men might not approach her save in the presence of some third party.
She had heard some one come in at the back, and go upstairs, and go out again.

The eyes were set in so dark, that one expected them to be black and flashing.

The first thing she saw was Louis, in his shirt sleeves, on the landing above.
So he took her in both arms, powerful, mysterious, horrible in the pitch dark.
Look, it is a gift-day for youâ€”â€  Madame smilingly led Alvina to her place.
I have been out and done my shopping, and already begun to prepare the dinner.
But Ciccio, with an obstinate and ugly little smile on his face, followed her.
â€œAt four oâ€™clock.â€  â€œJust about the time when we get there,â€ she said.
â€œIf Miss Houghton would just _allow_ me to run round and bring something in.
â€œIâ€™m only sorry to think Miss Houghton has _lost_ so steadily all evening.
â€œNow!â€  His yellow-tawny eyes looked down into hers, alien and overbearing.
She felt her native place insulted her: and she felt the Natchas insulted her.
She found Ciccio waiting at the end of the yard: eternally waiting, it seemed.
Then Iâ€™ve the bag I shall travel with.â€  â€œReally!â€ gasped Miss Pinnegar.
Madame was a little irritable, and very exacting, and inclined to be spiteful.
Wherever she was, Madame bought the food for the party, and cooked it herself.
â€œIâ€™m sorry!â€ he continued loudly, in his strange frenzy like a small boy.
She would have liked to squirt water down his brown, handsome, oblivious neck.
They talked as they would never talk before men, or before feminine outsiders.
And weâ€™re dying to be serenaded, arenâ€™t we, nurse?â€ She turned to Alvina.

Giuseppe was his son: Giuseppe of Battersea, in whose house Alvina had stayed.
Pancrazio slept in the unfurnished bedroom opposite, on a pile of old clothes.
Pancrazio would be gallantly heating milk for her, at the end of a long stick.

Where is the money you took?â€  â€œSpent it for whisky.â€  â€œNo, you didnâ€™t.
Two days later Chester found another letter from Mr. Conrad at the post office.
When about eight years of age Chester had made the journey, but not since then.
He asked me to inquire if he left his gloves here?â€  â€œI havenâ€™t found any.
I canâ€™t help it.â€  â€œI think he gives the right explanation,â€ said Arthur.
How many lots do you own?â€  â€œFive.â€  â€œTake my advice and hold on to them.
Near the entrance, just inside the hotel, Chester heard himself called by name.

â€œI congratulate you, Mr. Tripp, on making an unusually profitable investment.
Abel Wood was again in his employ, but he didnâ€™t like him as well as Chester.
He offered me five hundred dollars apiece cash down.â€  â€œDonâ€™t you take it!
â€œNo, sir,â€ answered Mr. Perkins; â€œbut if Chester ever wants me to, I will.
How do you propose to pay me the nine hundred and sixty-odd dollars you owe me?
â€œYes; what of him?â€  â€œIt is a gentleman from Portland, a neighbor of ours.
He was of medium height, with dark hair, and had a brisk, Western way with him.
She probably misses you.â€  â€œShe never writes to me,â€ said Edward, bitterly.

Standing at a desk in the rear of the office was a figure that looked familiar.
These sales contributed a good deal to Mrs. Houghtonâ€™s nervous heart-disease.
Every morning alike, she felt an invasion of some enemy was breaking in on her.
And so from the first Alvina spoke with a quiet, refined, almost convent voice.
In the street her walk had a delicate, lingering motion, her face looked still.
In the same manner she would look into the faces of the young men of Woodhouse.
Miss Frost was worn and rather heavy: her old buoyancy and brightness was gone.
She wanted tacit admission of difference, not open, wholehearted communication.
And it took her fatherâ€™s sortâ€”as well as her motherâ€™s and Miss Frostâ€™s.
But water dripped dismally in places, and there was a stale feeling in the air.
She was so swift and sensitive in her nursing, she seemed to have second sight.
Alvina kissed her, and could not suppress the whimpering of her too-much grief.
Alvina inherited the few simple trinkets, and about forty-five pounds in money.
At one time he showed the alarming symptom of brooding over his wifeâ€™s death.
If you havenâ€™t got the qualities which attract loose men, what are you to do?
â€œGood-evening!â€ she said, just a trifle condescendingly, as she shook hands.
Yet it was hard to believe that it mattered to himâ€”or that anything mattered.
His love for conversation had degenerated into a spasmodic passion for chatter.
The cold and supercilious look of anger, a little spiteful, came into his face.
The most vulgar, sordid and humiliating of all forms of slavery: so mechanical.
But how am I to _live_?â€  Jamesâ€™s head still vibrated in a negative fashion.
And for the same wage you could get some unimportant fellow with strong wrists.
_How_ I stood it, I donâ€™t knowâ€”â€  â€œNow donâ€™t you see her?â€  â€œNever!
â€œWhat a low opinion you have of human nature!â€  â€œHave I?â€ laughed Alvina.
She laughed when she saw his thrilling announcements in the _Woodhouse Weekly_.
Oh!â€ Madame folded her hands, but her black eyes still darted venom at Ciccio.
â€œItâ€™s this way.â€ She groped for him in the dark, and met his groping hand.
â€œYou have been good to KishwÃ©gin, and KishwÃ©gin has a heart that remembers.
May I go through?â€  They heard his quick little step and his quick little tap.
She was struggling into her shoes, she had her hat on, when the others arrived.
I should be awfully gladâ€”but donâ€™t buyâ€”â€ Alvina checked herself in time.
Mother said he was like a showman in a booth.â€  Miss Pinnegar was taken aback.
Itâ€™s all against his better nature.â€  â€œReally!â€ said Alvina, in surprise.
And then he gave the faintest gesture with his head, as of summons towards him.
Tonight we shall find a name.â€  After tea they inquired for a room for Alvina.
Ciccio touched his friend on his broad cheek, and smiled at him with affection.
He wrote, slowly, but with the beautiful Italian hand, the name of his village.
What is your choice, gentlemen?â€  â€œBeer,â€ said Ciccio, and Geoffrey nodded.
â€œDonâ€™t you see thatâ€™s insulting.â€  â€œ_Insulting!_ Well, I donâ€™t know.
â€œThou art the tame bear of Allaye.â€  Geoffrey strained Ciccio to his breast.
Loveâ€™s young dream is never so delicious as at the virgin age of fifty-three.
Fancy seeing his red, smiling face just above hers, coming down to embrace her!
She would be so comfortable, she would be so well-off for the rest of her life.
Why do you send a telegram?â€  Alvina sat down and covered her face, trembling.
â€œWe must get down hereâ€”the cart doesnâ€™t go any further,â€ said Pancrazio.
She washed her cup and her enamelled plate, and she tried to clean the kitchen.
Then she saw him making his way quickly back through the crowd, to rejoin them.
As he joined them near the village he hailed them in English:  â€œGood morning.
I am only here for a trip.â€  He was a little Italian shop-keeper from Glasgow.
The world beyond could not help, but it still had the power to injure one here.
When she stood above the valley in the strong, tiring light, she glanced round.
Astonishing the ferocity of the sun, when he really took upon himself to blaze.
I donâ€™t understand.â€ He wiped his sleeve across his face, and turned to her.

The next day he went to the office of _The Phoenix_ and carried in two sketches.

Here was the old Alvina come back, rather battered and deteriorated, apparently.
She cared more for her than she did for her own motherâ€”and her mother knew it.
Hence men were afraid of herâ€”of her power, once they had committed themselves.
â€œAlbert will look after it.â€  â€œThereâ€™s your chance,â€ said Arthur rudely.
Then he looked as suspiciously at the hand which Albert at last extended to him.

He had trailed his way back to England, where he had left his wife and daughter.

Alvina had quite a serious flirtation with a man who played a flute and piccolo.
The two _braves_ converse in dumb show, KishwÃ©gin swings the cradle and croons.

â€œEh, youâ€™d think heâ€™d get his death,â€ the women in the crowd were saying.
And the Natcha-Kee-Tawara Troupe was blowing like a rag of old paper into Limbo.
When Madame came downstairs Louis, who was a good satirical mimic, imitated him.
Mr. May returned, and said that Ciccio had ridden off down the Knarborough Road.
Madame effected the reunion of her troupe, and all seemed pretty much as before.
And a flash of delight went over her, that changed into a sob of mortal anguish.
She had unlocked it before she went out, for that entrance was hardly ever used.
Ay, but James sank it all in Throttle-Haâ€™penny and Klondyke and the Endeavour.
Without her, he would have felt too horribly uncomfortable on that raw hillside.
Some obstinate will in her own self absolutely refused to have her mind made up.
There, in that black town, thank heaven, she saw their announcement on the wall.
You have got the ticket, have you?â€ Alvina handed the luggage ticket to Madame.
As she was busy washing a garment in the bowl, her landlady knocked and entered.
You donâ€™t want to give away such a thing.â€  â€œI donâ€™t mind,â€ said Alvina.
â€œThe stair is so dark.â€  He looked at her, and turned as if to get the light.
Then you will go to Woodhouse tomorrow, and come to Mansfield on Monday morning?
And yet she shrank from the long, inscrutable gaze of his black-set, tawny eyes.
Mrs. Rollings is coming in at four againâ€”â€  â€œOh all rightâ€”â€ said Alvina.
You know the Watsons are there.â€  â€œI believe youâ€™d be happy,â€ said Alvina.
â€œSee if there is any money.â€  He watched her steadily, and his brow darkened.
â€œAnd at a sufficient salary?â€  â€œQuite sufficient, thank you,â€ said Alvina.
All the repulsive secrecy, and all the absolute power of the police authorities.
She read and pondered hard, recalling all her previous experience and knowledge.
Her nurseâ€™s dresses were packed in her trunk at Mrs. Slaneyâ€™s, in Woodhouse.
You never told me.â€  â€œI thought it would be no use if it all came to nothing.
Wherever he went, there was a scuffle directly his foot was heard on the stairs.
Cucumbers are the worst thing you can eat.â€  â€œOh!â€ said the man, stuttering.
â€œBut you mind being disturbed at your tea, I am sure.â€  â€œNo,â€ said Alvina.
Max and Louis were Swiss, it would not affect them: nor Ciccio, who was Italian.
She avoided his love-making, by telling him any sort of spooniness revolted her.
Yes do!â€ She stretched out her long white arm to Alvina, with sudden imploring.
But Iâ€™ve only got black clothes, except uniforms.â€  â€œWell look here nowâ€”!
She kept it in her room till I came and took it.â€  â€œAll right,â€ said Alvina.
The train was now so hot that the iron plate on the floor burnt Alvinaâ€™s feet.
Ciccio was handing up the handbags to the roof of one of the big post-omnibuses.
It ended by the rolling up of the burly, black moustached driver of the omnibus.
And Pancrazio lamented in his elegant English that no butter was to be obtained.
Crowds accompanied them to Ossona, whence they were marched towards the railway.

In the repertory of Lucian occurs a show piece on each side of this proposition.

In his palmy days, James Houghton was _crÃªme de la crÃªme_ of Woodhouse society.
A year after the death of Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost became ill and suddenly died.
He is a perfect stranger to me.â€  And with this Alvina subtly contented herself.
She went upstairs and looked at his photographâ€”his dark and impertinent muzzle.
Do you think you could bear it?â€  â€œYes, Iâ€™m sure I could,â€ retorted Alvina.
Alvina floated off to her room, and sat by the window looking down on the street.
It was most curious to see Miss Pinnegar turtle up at the mention of this scheme.
â€œItâ€™s absolutely ridiculous!â€ she repeated, unable to do more than splutter.
The Allsops were great Chapel people, and Cassie Allsop was one of the old maids.
Alvina really liked Arthur, and thought a good deal about himâ€”heaven knows why.
â€œYou donâ€™t mean to say youâ€™re nervous?â€ said Arthur rudely and sneeringly.
â€œThereâ€™s nothing against it, is there?â€  â€œOh, itâ€™s not that,â€ she said.
Perhaps neither of us was properly inclined.â€  â€œI should think so,â€ she said.
The hard white light showed her somewhat haggard-looking as she reached up to it.
He was even rather smart, judging from his yellow socks and yellow-and-brown tie.
Alvina looked across at Miss Pinnegar, as the two sat at the meagre supper-table.
Yet it was the kind of show that appealed to Mr. May: pictures between the turns.
It was with great difficulty he preserved his man-to-man openness and brightness.
James started as he nipped into the shop entrance, and found her confronting him.
â€œHow old is your daughter?â€  â€œFourteen.â€  â€œWhat is her name?â€  â€œGemma.
She stood outside on the trodden grass behind the Band of Hope, and really cried.
The navvies were busy in troops along the Knarborough Road, and down Lumley Hill.
James now gave two performances each eveningâ€”and he always had _some_ audience.
She herself had eaten one, but she laid her hand on her chest when she swallowed.
He asked the same questions again and again, to try and make sure how bad it was.
â€œHave you eaten anything?â€  â€œOne little mouthful,â€ said Madame plaintively.
Louisâ€™ trousers were cut rather tight at the waist, and gave him a female look.
The girls opposite shrieked again, for all the world like a gang of grey baboons.
But there are other men besides these hereâ€”â€ She waved her hand to the window.
â€œBut I donâ€™t know what you call my nonsense.â€  â€œAh,â€ said Madame wearily.
Ah, such canaille should be beaten, as dogs are beaten, till they follow at heel.
Ciccio smiled slowly, the slow, fine, stupid smile, and turned to walk alongside.
In the morning?â€  â€œDo!â€ cried Alvina, as Miss Pinnegar came through the door.
â€œThereâ€™s nothing _else_, is there?â€  â€œWouldnâ€™t you stay on?â€ she asked.
â€œI donâ€™t believe any good will come of it.â€  â€œBut why?â€ persisted Alvina.
She was so still, so remote, she felt that nothing, nothing could ever touch her.
Then she said gravely:  â€œWell!â€”yes!â€”well!â€ She looked from one to another.
But Alvina was concerned only to flatter the plump, white, soft vanity of Madame.
Alvina wanted to water her wine, but was not allowed to insult the sacred liquid.
Pacohuila, la musica!â€ cried Madame, starting to her feet and sounding frenzied.
Come now, itâ€™s worth a hextra quart to me, else I shanâ€™t have it, I shanâ€™t.
He strayed alongside as if he half belonged, and half didnâ€™tâ€”most irritating.
She evoked the images of her mother and Miss Frost: ladies, and noble women both.
Then, as she met his eyes,  â€œTo Woodhouse?â€ he said, watching her, to fix her.
â€œThen come on bicycle.â€  â€œYouâ€™re content to leave me,â€ muttered Geoffrey.
â€œSommes dâ€™accord.â€  â€œBen!â€ said Ciccio, holding out his hand for the bag.
â€œYes, youâ€™re a lost girl,â€ sobbed Miss Pinnegar, on a final note of despair.
Cold in the winter, hot in the summerâ€”â€  â€œAs cold as England?â€ said Alvina.
When I was a small boy my father, he died, and my mother comes with me to Naples.
Cette compagnie nâ€™est pas de ma choix.â€  â€œAllez!â€ said Ciccio, more loudly.
â€œYes, I do.â€  â€œWouldnâ€™t you rather wait, and seeâ€”â€  â€œWhat?â€ he said.
She would not be able to take the twelve-forty train, for it was already mid-day.
But thereâ€™s Sharps and Fullbanks to pay.â€  â€œIâ€™ll pay those,â€ said Alvina.
Her face was cold and distant, but she smiled slightly as she bade them good-bye.
She smiled to herself when she saw his large and important presence on the board.
Iâ€™ve got to call on the way.â€  â€œWhere have you got to call?â€  She told him.
And Iâ€™m much too much in love with you to let you go on indefinitely like this.
She had seen him lurking in the streets of the town, but had never spoken to him.
She found Mrs. Tuke crouched in a chair, with a drawn, horrified, terrified face.
It was beautiful, and Alvina felt she had known it all before, in a happier life.
Alvina noticed the shuffle of his skin-sandalled feet, the quiet step of the ass.
The fierce, savage gods who dipped their lips in blood, these were the true gods.
For had he not travelled Europe with English gentlemen, as a sort of model-valet!
She knew how he loved herâ€”almost inhumanly, elementally, without communication.
Alvina saw them dropping hurriedly down the incline between the twiggy wild oaks.
I suffered so much, that I must lean against the wall to support me to walk home.
On sunny days Alvina walked down to the desolate river-bed, which fascinated her.
The moment she went through a door the sense of dark repulsiveness came over her.
They bewitched you with loveliness, and lurked with fangs to hurt you afterwards.
Then the cool wind came in a storm, the next day there was grey sky and soft air.
These were days of waitingâ€”horrible days of waiting for Ciccio to be called up.

He turned lazily as he heard the door open, and let his glance rest on Mr. Conrad.
â€œNo, he isnâ€™t.â€  â€œIâ€™ve come in about the monthâ€™s rent.â€  â€œVery well!
He was not partial to poor people or tenement houses, and he was glad to get away.

â€œNo; I never saw a pair of boxing gloves before.â€  â€œI will give you a lesson.
â€œDonâ€™t make too much of such a trifle, Chester!â€ returned the other, lightly.
He had never before ridden in such a conveyance and the sensation was a novel one.

Miss Frost imperceptibly took into her hands the reins of the domestic government.
James had now a new direction to run in: down hill towards Bagthorpe, to Klondyke.
Alvina immediately burst into tears and flung herself into the arms of Miss Frost.
The upshot was, that Alvina was to go to Islington for her six monthsâ€™ training.
They looked at her, as if she were Woman itself, some creature not quite personal.
What was left unsaid mattered more to Alvina now than anything that was expressed.
Itâ€™s a bronchial cold,â€ whispered Miss Frost hurriedly, trying to sip the milk.
But youâ€™ll feel other thingsâ€”â€  â€œI havenâ€™t the heart,â€ persisted Alvina.
Against her usual habit, Alvina joined the plumber and her father in the scullery.
He spent his vacations in Woodhouseâ€”and he was only in his first year at Oxford.
Then stubbornly, he rigged them up again, and stared again at his interrupted job.
â€œIâ€™d rather have my own mistakes than somebody elseâ€™s rights,â€ said Alvina.
They discoursed amiably as they went, James bending forward, Mr. May bending back.
But she hardened herself once more, though the effort cost her a year of her life.
Alvina walked down to Lumley and was shown the site and was introduced to Mr. May.
I lost I donâ€™t know how many pounds, the first year I was married to that woman.
He was satisfied with Mr. May: he had to admit that he was satisfied with Mr. May.
Wait a minute, Iâ€™ll see if we havenâ€™t got some of those pastilles for burning.
â€œWill you let me take your temperature?â€  Madame started and looked frightened.
He kissed it quickly, then turned aside his head because of the tears in his eyes.
But Ciccio, stretching forward taut and immobile with rage, was quite unconscious.
We are wondering which way Ciccio will have gone, on to Knarborough or to Marchay.
Madame, who was dancing KishwÃ©gin on the last evening, cast sharp glances at her.
â€œIs it finished?â€  â€œYes, I think.â€ He reached his pump and blew up the tire.
Wellâ€”youâ€™d better come into the other room, to the fire,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
Only her large eyes looked blue in their tiredness, as she glanced down at Ciccio.
He studied her with alert, yellow-dusky, inscrutable eyes, until she met his look.
She went to the mirror, still, evanescent, and tidied her hair, smoothed her face.
She looked at his frail, handsome, ethereal face, and crossed herself as she wept.
A posse of minor tradesmen followed the cabsâ€”all in black and with black gloves.
Uncouth, they seemed to him, all raw angles and harshness, like their own weather.
Itâ€™s enoughâ€”itâ€™s enoughâ€”â€  And there was a silence between the two women.
â€œTonight,â€ she said, â€œthe Natcha-Kee-Tawaras make their feast of affiliation.
â€œThen you will become one of the tribe of Natcha-Kee-Tawara, of the name Allaye?
Save for the fatal numbness of her love for him, she could still have escaped him.
â€œSeems yer doinâ€™ yersen a bit oâ€™ weshinâ€™.â€  Still Alvina didnâ€™t answer.
He was playing the wildly-yearning Neapolitan songs, of which Alvina knew nothing.
â€œArenâ€™t I comical?â€  She took him upstairsâ€”first to the monumental bedroom.
When they climbed the stairs, he fingered the big, smooth mahogany bannister-rail.
Most decidedly, most one-sidedly, if I may use the vulgarism, I _seeâ€”eâ€”e!_ Oh!
â€œAnd when are you going to let this fatal decision take effect?â€ asked Mr. May.
Luxuriously, she resented having to get up and tackle her heap of broken garments.
For she felt that once she had left, she could never come back to Woodhouse again.
They kept to themselvesâ€”and Alvina kept to herselfâ€”and Madame kept to herself.
If nobody makes you, and yet you feel it, it must be in yourself, donâ€™t you see?

And that eveningâ€”it was Fridayâ€”Ciccio did not rise to accompany her to her house.
â€œWoodhouse has nothing for me any more.â€  â€œOf course it hasnâ€™t,â€ said Alvina.
Of _cauce_, at such a figure.â€  â€œYes, it is a permanent engagement,â€ said Alvina.

For twenty years, she and James Houghton treated each other with a courteous distance.
He had shaved his side-whiskers, so that they only grew becomingly as low as his ears.
CHAPTER II THE RISE OF ALVINA HOUGHTON   The heroine of this story is Alvina Houghton.
She remained for twenty years the demure, refined creature of her governessâ€™ desire.
The influence of the man was revoked, the girl was left uninhabited, empty and uneasy.
â€œPersonally,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, speaking of Alexander, â€œI donâ€™t care for him.
He is nothing to me.â€  Miss Frost became gradually silent, and turned aside her face.
They had a certain life, and you had to take them at their own worth in their own way.
Imagine her motherâ€™s startled, almost expiring:  â€œWhy, Vina dear!â€  Vina laughed.
For the moment there was a sense of prosperityâ€”or probable prosperity, in the house.
She sorted all her motherâ€™s clothesâ€”expensive, old-fashioned clothes, hardly worn.
The long semi-consciousness and the tearing pain of pneumonia, the anguished sickness.
Will you come in.â€  They sat in the middle room, the common living room of the house.
He would end by making a sufficient fortune, and by being a town councillor and a J.P.
For James Houghton had the impudence to make her an allowance of two shillings a week.
But I do mental science for my own interest.â€  Alvina had taken up a piece of sewing.
The kernel, the man himselfâ€”seemed so tenderâ€”the covering so stiff and insentient.
The next day she did not go to Morning Service, but stayed at home to cook the dinner.
Whether she would ever be able to take to his strange and dishuman element, who knows?
Everything was possible: and even desirable, once one could see the strangeness of it.
True enough, in Alvinaâ€™s pig-tail of soft brown the grey hairs were already showing.
He bent forward as he walked, and still nipped along hurriedly, as if pursued by fate.
If you go in a pinch-and-scrape fashion in the beginning, you will get nowhere at all.
He bought himself a new, smart overcoat, that fitted his figure, and a new velour hat.
His interest was still the human interest in living performers and their living feats.
Odd, extraneous creatures, often a little depressed, feeling life slip away from them.
He was fairly tall, but loosely built for an Italian, with slightly sloping shoulders.
Alvina had warned Max that she wanted Madame to be kept as quiet as possible this day.
There was a certain biting, annihilating quality in Louisâ€™ derision of the absentee.
â€œNo.â€  â€œHe says he is going back to Italy?â€  â€œTo London.â€  â€œIt is the same.
Tell him that, the coward, that causes a womanâ€™s word to be broken against her will.
She turned round and took the door-handle, still holding his fingers in her left hand.
He did not feel safe for one single moment whilst he depended on a single one of them.
When the daughter entered the ticket place, her father was again in a state of torpor.
He tried to talk to Alvina in a fatherly fashion, or a friendly, or a helpful fashion.
She remained there on the doorstep, neutral, blanched, with wide, still, neutral eyes.
â€œThe old oneâ€”the Missâ€”Miss Pinâ€”Pinnyâ€”what you call her.â€  â€œMiss Pinnegar!
â€œYouâ€™ll come again, wonâ€™t you?â€ She looked at him from her strained, pale face.
Madame made him a secret, imperative gesture that he should accompany the young woman.
Dash my rags, itâ€™s a caution!â€  â€œI havenâ€™t got five shillingsâ€”â€ said Alvina.
She followed the squat, intent figure with her eye, to the public-house at the corner.
Shall I trust you thenâ€”?â€  Madame usually had a kitchen to herself, in the morning.
Quickly she opened the house-door and slipped inside, shutting it sharply in his face.
His eyes watched her as a cat watches a bird, but without the white gleam of ferocity.
You make me feel I shall go out of my mind.â€  â€œBut I _donâ€™t_ know,â€ said Alvina.
And he crept stealthily upstairs on tip-toe, a comical, flush-faced, tubby little man.
â€œI canâ€™t now.â€  He laughed in a sinister way: yet with a certain warmheartedness.
â€œWell,â€ he said, feeling with a finger-tip an imaginary roughness of one nail-edge.
Marasca is going by the train, heâ€™ll have to have a little cold meat,â€ said Alvina.
Alvina preferred the labourers with their awful long moustaches that got full of food.
As a matter of fact, he was conscious of the fact that he had risen to be a gentleman.
With a barely perceptible shake of the head, she refused, staring at him all the time.
And if he says you are indispensableâ€”â€  This was a new idea for Alvina to cogitate.
He was just walking away with her down the road, clinging fast to her, enveloping her.
â€œIsnâ€™t this like Italy?â€  He looked darkly out of the window, and shook his head.
For the first time she opened her eyes on a continent, the Alpine core of a continent.
They all picked their way down into the great white-bouldered bed of a mountain river.
He took a long iron tube or blow-pipe, which rested on two little feet at the far end.

So he had to lie shouting underneath me until some one came to the studio to untie me.
They were patched with a hideous, greenish mould-colour, blotched, as if with leprosy.
Nobody young can stop here.â€  The odd plangent certitude in his voice penetrated her.
It was the flowers that brought back to Alvina the passionate nostalgia for the place.

At the end of that time, how do you think I stood?â€  â€œHow?â€ asked Mullins, eagerly.
â€œSend him out!â€ suggested Dick, in a still lower tone, but Chester caught the words.
The expense was a consideration, and again he found it difficult to leave his business.
I certainly hope so.â€  â€œWhat shall you do about Ralston?â€ asked Chester, presently.
â€œI hope if you have money to spare you will put it in some savings bank,â€ she wrote.

And invariably, when they wilted, she touched them with a sudden gentle touch, pitying.
And father and daughter alike calmly expected Woodhouse demand to rise to their supply.
The days, the months darkened past, and Alvina returned to her old thinness and pallor.
Why should anybody expect to be _made happy_, and develop heart-disease if she isnâ€™t?
In the months that followed her motherâ€™s death, Alvina went on the same, in abeyance.
And continually the young woman exhorted the elder to work less, to give up her pupils.
If there was, heaven knows what it might have been, for their talk was ordinary enough.
To one of her gossips Miss Pinnegar confessed:  â€œI thought sheâ€™d have felt it more.
But Alfred Swayn, from the Liquor Vaults, would put him in the running in five minutes.
James took on his refined, abstracted look, as if he were preoccupied on higher planes.
Good-night!â€ She gave him her hand and turned quickly into the shop, closing the door.
â€œWould you mind holding the steps, so that they donâ€™t let me down again,â€ he said.
â€œYou seem somewhat quiet at Lumley,â€ he said, in his odd, refined-showmanâ€™s voice.
â€œI should think youâ€™ll never turn Alvina out on such a night,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
â€œYou know I have been a nurse.â€  â€œAh, you are too kind, too kind, dear young lady.
Queer, dainty woman, was Madame, even to her wonderful threaded black-and-gold garters.
You are not bad looking, only a little too thinâ€”too haggardâ€”â€  She watched Alvina.
â€œYounger than you, because I am practical from the heart, and not only from the head.
Then she closed the door behind her, and stood with her back to it, facing the Italian.
In the back yard the bicycles were out, glittering and muddy according to their owners.
â€œWe shall have to convert into all pictures,â€ he said in a nervous fever to Mr. May.
In her soul she was sceptical of their keeping their promiseâ€”either Madame or Ciccio.
They made him drink brandy, the boy was sent for the doctor, Alvinaâ€™s bed was warmed.
She doubled herself up in a paroxysm on her knees on the floorâ€”because she loved him.
Sometimes he looked at her, as Madame talked, and again looked at her, and looked away.
Her eyes had a bright, slightly-bewildered look as she turned from one face to another.
â€œHas the bird flown home?â€ chanted KishwÃ©gin, to one of the strains of their music.
As she was doing her hair, she heard the plaintive nasal sound of Ciccioâ€™s mandoline.
And now there is not much time.â€  â€œI am going to Woodhouse,â€ said Ciccio in French.
Geoffrey and Ciccio talked to each other in French, and kept each other in countenance.
And nowâ€”â€  He went into certain technical matters, and Alvina signed some documents.
And when have we got to get out?â€  â€œOh, I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a desperate hurry.
And yet she could not bring herself to speak of it to Madame till the Saturday evening.
So that it was tiring work, which left her no time to herself, except just in snatches.
But if he is gnawed with anxiety lest he may _not_ be a gentleman, he is only pitiable.
She smiled when she saw him at a sale, buying the grandest pieces of antique furniture.
â€œIâ€™ll wonder about you till Iâ€™ve made up my mindâ€”shall I?â€  â€œYes,â€ he said.
â€œNow I know you love me.â€ The pleased self-satisfaction in his voice made her angry.
â€œYou may congratulate Nurse Houghton and me on our engagementâ€”â€ He smiled largely.
It was one of the well-known Neapolitan songs, and Ciccio sang it as it should be sung.
Effie insisted on my coming to see you.â€  There was Ciccio climbing down with the bag.
Before, he had seemed to make himself invisible in the streets, in England, altogether.
And so the big, heavy train drew out, leaving the others small and dim on the platform.
And then the train set off again in the night for Alessandria and Genoa, Pisa and Rome.
Everywhere the hard-faced women came and stared into Alvinaâ€™s face, asking questions.
Pancrazio went first with the candleâ€”then Ciccio with the black kettleâ€”then Alvina.
She had gone beyond the world into the pre-world, she had reopened on the old eternity.
And even she, English housewife as she was, realized the futility of trying to wash it.
Alvina began to feel she would die, in the awful comfortless meaninglessness of it all.
When she was well enough they set off one early Monday morning to the market in Ossona.
Snow had fallenâ€”not much round the house, but deep between the banks as they climbed.
On the platform of the high-way, above the valley, people were parading in the hot sun.
Could Alvina bear to be so far off, when such terrible events were happening near home?

Now and then their jokes at our expense would produce hilarious laughter among the men.
Those we had already hired they now snatched from the donkeys standing before the tent.

For James Houghton was a dreamer, and something of a poet: commercial, be it understood.
Wonderful that he did not think of the days when these bits and bobs were new treasures.
Knowing nothing, yet her ancient sapience went deep, deeper than Woodhouse could fathom.
â€œBut what do you want, dear?â€ asked Miss Frost, knitting her dark brows in agitation.
At this calculation she would make an easy three hundred a year, without slaving either.
But she was deep, and there was some secret satisfaction in her very quality of secrecy.
Just sixty-three pounds in the bankâ€”no more: then the clothes, piano, books and music.
She was a woman of thirty-five, a bit of a shrew, with social ambitions and no children.
Why, then you canâ€™t be a prostitute, if you try your head off: nor even a loose woman.
â€œTake it while youâ€™ve got it.â€  Now Alvina did not want to learn to ride a bicycle.
She put her fingers over the bone, over his stocking, to feel if there was any fracture.
He stared flatly in front of him, and flatly set a wall of oblivion between him and her.
Ach, schon dreissig           Ach, schon dreissig Immer MÃ¤dchen, MÃ¤dchen heissâ€™ ich.
James was very shabby, in his black coat and dark grey trousers, and his cheap grey cap.
Arenâ€™t we _fortunate_!â€ cried Mr. May, perking up the moment they were in the street.
Or I can act just as your managerâ€”you can _employ_ meâ€”â€  He watched Jamesâ€™s face.
Poor Mr. May had to gather together his wits and his sprightliness for his next meeting.
But poor Miss Pinnegar after this looked older, and seemed to get a little round-backed.
Mr. Houghton said, hurriedly interposing, that he meant to make a little opening speech.
â€œWell,â€ said Mr. May, â€œdone well?â€  â€œFairly well,â€ said James, huskily excited.
He was not very large, but nicely shaped, and with no hair on his smooth, tattooed body.
Open the door for her, Ciccioâ€”â€  Ciccio reached across at the door, but was too late.
Only Ciccio kept the thin smile on his lips, and added to Madameâ€™s annoyance and pain.
Alvina noticed the brown, slender Mediterranean hand, as he put his fingers to his lips.
Looking along the road they saw all the shopkeepers at their doors, the pavements eager.
So they advanced down the grey pallor of Knarborough Road, in the late wintry afternoon.
Madame darted a look at her, her lips curling with a very faint, fine smile of derision.
You would like a little whiskey?â€”yes?â€  Max poured out whiskey and water for Mr. May.
Geoffrey waited a moment for a tram which was rushing brilliantly up to him in the rain.
And suddenly she kissed his hand, kissed it twice, quickly, on the fingers and the back.
â€œDo you like continually going away?â€ she said, her wide blue eyes fixed on his face.
â€œI shall have to look for something else,â€ said the injured but dauntless little man.
â€œWhy?â€  â€œI donâ€™t believe in the place, and I never did,â€ declared Miss Pinnegar.
Which of them it was, or what it was that had cast the spell over her, she did not know.
Mr. May found James Houghton fainting in the box-office after the performance had begun.
As if he was anything to _them_â€”â€  â€œI think itâ€™s very nice of her,â€ said Alvina.
And if he beats you, you are helplessâ€”â€  â€œBut why should he beat me?â€ said Alvina.
Alvina rose to wipe the dishes, hastily, because the funeral guests would all be coming.
During the days following the funeral, no one could have been more tiresome than Alvina.
She would _not_ have her mind made up for her, and she would not make it up for herself.
Geoffrey inclined his head, and Ciccio lowered his eyelashes in indication of agreement.
â€œYou know, my dear,â€ she said afterward to Alvina, â€œI understand sympathy in music.
I catched sight on â€™im goinâ€™ out, but I didna maâ€™e out then which on â€™em it wor.
Will you really go alone?â€  â€œYes, I want to go to the womenâ€™s shops,â€ said Alvina.
â€œNo hurry,â€ said Ciccio, and he took away her parcels from her, as if he had a right.
She very nearly saidâ€”â€œI may stay in Woodhouse altogether.â€ But she held her tongue.
You would!â€  He turned his eyes aside, and looked at her hands as she washed the forks.
â€œWell,â€ he said, with a little nod, and a furtive look of triumph about him, evasive.
â€œBecause,â€ said Alvina gaily, â€œwe can please ourselves what we do, whatever we say.
â€œHello, Tommy!â€ called Mrs. Tuke to her husband, whom she saw on the drive below her.
For three days it was all so sweet and lovelyâ€”perfect liberty, pure, almost paradisal.
Strange lights appeared in the sky, everybody seemed to be listening for strange noises.
Ciccio expostulated back again, and they pecked at each other, verbally, like two birds.
The natives kept themselves alive by going about constantly working, dumb and elemental.
The same helpless passion for the man, the same remoteness from the worldâ€™s actuality?
â€œItâ€™s because you are a foreigner, and they think you will go away again,â€ he said.
Well, he kept me tied up, hanging you know forwards naked on this cross, for four hours.
The lovely translucent pale irises, tiny and morning-blue, they lasted only a few hours.
â€œYes, we shall all have to go.â€ There seemed a certain sound of triumph in his voice.
The two men sat on the settle, with the lamp between them, reading and talking the news.

He is the storekeeper.â€  The young man laughed, but there was no merriment in the laugh.
Do you think we can give him a bed?â€  â€œWhy, certainly,â€ replied Mrs. Rand, cordially.
He felt that he had the key to the mystery, but he chose to defer throwing light upon it.
She is a spinster, and at her age there is not much chance of her changing her condition.

This is truly surprising.â€  â€œI didnâ€™t earn it by my art,â€ replied Chester, smiling.
â€œWonâ€™t I get somethinâ€™ for tryinâ€™ to save the kidâ€™s life?â€  â€œAs like as not.
I thought I should never see you again.â€  â€œI have not died that I am aware of, mother.

Before all this, however, before his marriage, James Houghton had built Manchester House.
But Miss Frost never felt so strongly moved to impatience as when she was within hearing.
She had pale grey eyes, and a padding step, and a soft voice, and almost purplish cheeks.
The new grocer whistled â€œJust Like the Ivy,â€ and shouted boisterously to his shop-boy.
Within six months he realized that every inch of elastic cost him exactly sixty per cent.
This was hosiery webbing, which could be cut up and made into as-yet-unheard-of garments.
Shabby old coal-carts rambled up behind the New Connection, and filled from the pit-bank.
Time passed like an express trainâ€”and she seemed to have known no other life than this.
Alvina was supposed to receive a certain fee for these cases she attended in their homes.
A small proportion of her fee she kept for herself, the rest she handed over to the Home.
These young men had the good nature of dogs that wag their tails and expect to be patted.
Is the only aim and end of a manâ€™s life, to make some woman, or parcel of women, happy?
The be-all and end-all of life doesnâ€™t lie in feminine happinessâ€”or in any happiness.
Yet each would have died for the other, would have done anything to spare the other hurt.
Everything was quite tidy in the short gang-ways down below, timbered and in sound order.
Theyâ€™ll be awfully expensive.â€  â€œWill they?â€ said Alvina, making big, mocking eyes.
I should do all I could to prevent him, if I were you.â€  Miss Allsop took her departure.
Lottie was determined he should take back to the Cape a suitable wife: presumably Alvina.
Well now, what could be more suitableâ€”a young man at Oxford, a young lady in Woodhouse.
â€œThanks.â€  â€œGo on,â€ he said, pressing a little nearer to her, and offering his arm.
Mother was so ill at the timeâ€”â€  â€œThereâ€™s always something to consider,â€ he said.
Then she dressed herself in her black dress once more, did her hair, and went downstairs.
And then he said, tentatively:  â€œHadnâ€™t we better think about the financial part now?
Itâ€™s quite simple.â€  â€œBut what are we going to do with a cinema show?â€ said Alvina.
James tripped silently alongside, bowed under the weight of his Gladstone bag of pennies.
I donâ€™t think I could bear it.â€  â€œAnd our pictures arenâ€™t good enough,â€ she said.
Most of them had an abstracted manner; in ordinary life, they seemed left aside, somehow.
The table also was covered with a brightly-patterned American oil-cloth, shiny but clean.
Ciccio meanwhile muttered something in Frenchâ€”evidently something rudeâ€”meant for Max.
It was curious how light his fingers were in their claspâ€”almost like a childâ€™s touch.
As they worked, Alvina tried in vain to dissociate the two _braves_ from their war-paint.
Alvina happened to come into their sitting-room in the midst of their bursts of laughter.
â€œHa-er-er!â€ he heard the answering shout, unmistakably Italian, way down the darkness.
At the corner of the street they waited for Geoffrey, who rode up muddily on his bicycle.
She stood watching him with wide, bright blue eyes, smiling slightly, and saying nothing.
In the same way he might have watched a serpent, had he found one gliding in the theatre.
â€œTu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu!â€ went Miss Pinnegarâ€™s tongue, in a rapid tut-tut of distress.
She was relieved by the intermission of fate, she was thankful for the day of neutrality.
And if he has you, it will cost him much more, he cannot continue with Natcha-Kee-Tawara.
Her coat did not seem warm enough, her old black seal-skin furs were not much protection.
When you have a little more fleshâ€”thenâ€”â€ Madame made a slight click with her tongue.
Ciccio sat on Alvinaâ€™s right, but he seemed to avoid looking at her or speaking to her.
And thus they watched the Sunday morning landscape slip by, as they ran into Knarborough.
Then he glanced up the stairs and along the corridor again, and downstairs into the hall.
Alvina flirted with the two men, played the piano to them, and suggested a game of cards.
You know what love isâ€”â€ And he put his arms round her, and laughed down into her face.
Alvina had known him since she was a child: but rather as an official than an individual.
â€œI will do my best,â€ he said, â€œto get what I can for you.â€  â€œOh well!â€ she said.
Yet instead of going home she turned off down the alley towards the fields and the brook.
â€œAnd there are your rings, and your chain, and your locketâ€”seeâ€”allâ€”everythingâ€”!
Only, with a fleeting thought, Alvina wondered if it would affect the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.
It was not till Alvina sat before her mirror that he opened her door softly, and entered.
He put a white muffler round himself, Alvina hugged herself in her beaver scarf and muff.
How wonderful the Alps were!â€”what a bigness, an unbreakable power was in the mountains!
Fog, eh!â€ The fat man whisked his fingers in the air, to indicate fog in the atmosphere.
â€œWarm yourself,â€ said the young woman, pointing to the flat disc of fire on the floor.
Ciccio, Alvina, Giovanni and the ass waited in the frosty starlight under the wild house.
She had most ostentatiously chased out an obtrusive hen, from this temple of cleanliness.
They left the house by starlight, but dawn was coming by the time they reached the river.
It was curious how little he went to Pescocalascio, how little he mixed with the natives.
When she went to Ossona with him, she knew everybody questioned him about her and Ciccio.

You ainâ€™t workinâ€™, yet you seem to have money.â€  â€œHow do you know I have?â€  â€œMr.
â€œYour money holds out well, Chester,â€ he said, as he made change for a two-dollar bill.

â€œDEAR SIR: We learn that you own five lots on Main Street, numbered     from 201 to 205.
When David Mullins saw Chester enter the office he turned pale, and looked panic-stricken.
Sitting in an armchair was his venerable friend of the train, appearing very much at home.
â€œHe told me he saw you drowned in New York Bay.â€  Edward regarded Floyd with curiosity.
We cannot say why James Houghton failed to become the Liberty or the Snelgrove of his day.
Not a grain of human feeling in the man, said Miss Frost, flushing pink with exasperation.
So that after a while, one loft was reserved for disused and rusty, but expensive engines.
Like many short-sighted people, she had a certain intent look of one who goes her own way.
She and her mother were the phantom passengers in the ship of James Houghtonâ€™s fortunes.
She knew she was rightâ€”amply and beautifully right, her darling, her beloved Miss Frost.
But as he found himself continually foiled, he became sulky, like a bear with a sore head.
For his touch and his kiss had that nearness of a little boyâ€™s, which nearly melted her.
Perhaps gnomes and subterranean workers, enslaved in the era of light, see with such eyes.
They could never remove the sense of waiting to finish: it was all just waiting to finish.
â€œWomenâ€™s faults mustnâ€™t be owned up to.â€  Alvina was beginning to feel quite dazed.
She felt she didnâ€™t know, she couldnâ€™t feel, she was just scattered and decentralized.
Will you accept them, Miss Houghton?â€ He stared at her with shining, pallid smiling eyes.
I donâ€™t see that theyâ€™re necessary.â€  â€œCertainly I think Tommy is a weak character.
It _is_ near enough.â€  â€œCome down with you, did they?â€ said Calladine good-humouredly.
If he had to clear out without paying his hotel billâ€”well, that was the worldâ€™s fault.
â€œYou see at the moment,â€ said Mr. May, â€œI have no funds that I can represent in cash.
That man!â€  James also came to the door, and peered out as if he expected to see a sight.
When she had sufficiently recovered, she went to her chair, and sat down before her plate.
â€œI have found an excellent manager, who knows the whole business thoroughlyâ€”a Mr. May.
Heâ€™s lost every bit of shameâ€”every bitâ€”if he ever had anyâ€”which I doubt very much.
Another day _still!_ But youâ€™re strangely indifferent to time, in your line of business.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawara Troupe consisted of five persons, Madame Rochard and four young men.
If itâ€™s very bad, I can make one of those plasters mother used.â€  And she ran upstairs.
If I am going to lie abandoned, I had better die at once.â€  â€œLie abandoned!â€ said Max.
Enter the _brave_ Louis with his white prisoner, Max, who has his hands bound to his side.
Miss Pinnegar and Alvina and James Houghton had come round into Knarborough Road to watch.
And yet you have a heart.â€  â€œBut all Englishwomen have good hearts,â€ protested Alvina.
I should have been _on_ the boards, instead of behind them.â€  â€œNo doubt,â€ said Madame.
Ciccio, the marasca, the bitter cherry, was standing on the edge of the crowd, looking on.
When she went down to the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras for breakfast she found them waiting for her.
So that Alvina, for all her wistfulness and subjectedness, was at last seriously offended.
If she inclined towards self-indulgence in any direction, it was in the direction of food.
â€œIf they are not stolen, you have the Holy Saints alone to be thankful for keeping them.
Have a good time, both.â€  So Alvina sped on in the fast train to Knarborough with Ciccio.
â€œFather left all to meâ€”and his debts as well, you see.â€  â€œMuch debts?â€  â€œOh yes!
â€œWhat is the name of it?â€  â€œPescocalascio.â€ He said the word subduedly, unwillingly.
Arenâ€™t we all ready to do our best to contribute to Miss Houghtonâ€™s happiness in love?
At a quarter to seven Miss Pinnegar came down, and went into the scullery to make her tea.
â€œYouâ€™d like it better if there was money.â€  A slow, sinister smile came on his mouth.
And nothing very unpleasant either, for that matter.â€  He gave her a shrewd little smile.
In the midst of the insult she remained isolated upon herself, and she wished to be alone.
A week or two.â€  â€œAnd is the cinematograph to be sold the same?â€  â€œYesâ€”everything!
I felt that low.â€  The doctor marched out of the room, still holding the mug in his hand.
He really, by degrees, made up his mind to marry now, and to retire in part from his work.
â€œBut donâ€™t ask me too soon, will you?â€  â€œHow, too soonâ€”?â€ He smiled delightedly.
She was really fussy and pleased with herself: and _quite_ decided sheâ€™d take it all on.
And this very fear, like a yoke on her, made her resent the man who drove her to decision.
Iâ€™m surprised at nothing they doâ€”â€  â€œI must say,â€ said Alvina, â€œI was surprised.
â€œI _shall_ see.â€  And it was true that Alvinaâ€™s will was indeterminate, at this time.
But not that she might be free to marry him, but that she might be at liberty to flee him.
A mandoline was wailing its vibration in the night outside, rapidly, delicately quivering.
And sure enough, came the fine tinkle of the mandoline, and after a few moments, the song.
The marriage was presumably with Dr. Mitchellâ€”though she had given him no definite word.
She took the time-table that hung in the hall: the time-table, that magic carpet of today.
She shuddered when she touched him, because he was so beautiful, and she was so submitted.
She sat and watched the black stationâ€”then she heard the sound of the childâ€™s trumpet.
Ciccio and Pancrazio clung to her, essentially, as if she saved them also from extinction.
One day she went along the high-road with her letters, towards the village of Casa Latina.
No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall hold pleas of our Crown.

Now many of her hearers disliked being secretly touched, as it were beneath their clothing.

In Manchester House they were all horrifiedâ€”not moved with grief, this time, but shocked.
Alvina remained bright and ready, the half-hilarious clang remained in her voice, taunting.
The air was filthyâ€”and yet never had her colour been so warm and fresh, her skin so soft.
Certainly Alvina represented the young doctors as very nice, but rather fast young fellows.
As a matter of fact, Alvina was detached for the time being from her interest in young men.
Iâ€™ve sometimes thought it never would come off.â€  â€œWhy?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know, exactly.
Suddenly one evening he appeared at the back door with a bunch of white stocks in his hand.
â€œFather,â€ said Alvina, â€œyou know Mr. Witham, donâ€™t you?â€  James Houghton half rose.
He did not think about what he was feeling, and he did not feel what he was thinking about.
Alvina had inherited Miss Frostâ€™s task of attending to the Chapel flowers once a quarter.
The jacket and waistcoat were bound with silk braid of exactly the same shade as the cloth.
But she wonâ€™t do anythingâ€”and if I were you I wouldnâ€™t ask her.â€  There was a pause.
Canâ€™t we hire some young fellowâ€”?â€ And he turned to Mr. Houghton with a note of query.
Iâ€™m afraid it will tire Miss Houghton to deathâ€”â€  â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€ said James.
â€œWell!â€ he said, shutting both his fists and flourishing them in Miss Pinnegarâ€™s face.
He told her how many times he had had blood-poisoning, during the process of his tattooing.
He was a tall Swiss with almond eyes and a flattish face and a rather stiff, ramrod figure.
Mr. May was listening to Max, who was telling in German all about the White Prisoner scene.
â€œAbsolutely nobody.â€ She looked with a confused laugh into Madameâ€™s strict black eyes.
â€œAre they!â€ said Alvina confusedly, feeling a blush burning up her throat into her face.
He hasnâ€™t done _that_, at least.â€  â€œWhere do you imagine heâ€™s gone?â€ asked Mr. May.
Then she went to say good-bye to the young men, who were in various stages of their toilet.
She swayed herself to and fro in a paroxysm of unbearable sensation, because she loved him.
Can you live in England as the wife of a labouring man, a dirty Eyetalian, as they all say?
â€œBoth,â€ said Alvina, busying herself with the gravy, to hide her distress and confusion.
It sends life downâ€”downâ€”instead of lifting it up.â€  â€œWhy should things always go up?
She did not pretend distress, but sat black-eyed and watchful, very much her business self.
And that night both slept in Miss Pinnegarâ€™s bed, out of sheer terror of the empty house.
There was a faction against the chapel faction, which favoured the plan sketched out above.
She answered Madameâ€™s post-card, but did not give much thought to the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.
Now she began to loathe the excitement of her property: doubtfully hers, every stick of it.
â€œYoâ€™ can â€™ing it iâ€™ thâ€™ back yard.â€  â€œI think itâ€™ll dry here,â€ said Alvina.
At the back of her thoughts, all she minded was that Ciccio did not pay her some attention.
She herself felt, in the same way, something of an outcast, because of the man at her side.
You know, they hate dogs, wolves do.â€ He made a queer noise, to show how wolves hate dogs.
Open, yes, wide openâ€”â€ He spread his arms from his ample chest, at the end of the table.
She cleared away the supper and carried away all glasses and bottles from the drawing-room.
Heâ€™s going now.â€  Miss Pinnegar came downstairs again, and went through to the scullery.
â€œThe lawyer has just told me fatherâ€™s debts come to much more than everything is worth.
So Iâ€™ve got to get my own clothes and boots together, or theyâ€™ll be sold with the rest.
â€œI quite agree with the matron.â€  â€œOh, you do!â€ He did not quite know how to take it.
He fumbled feverishly in his pocket with one hand, holding her still fast by the other arm.
But her will, like a spring that is hitched somehow, did not fly direct against the doctor.
â€œThereâ€™s not _one bit_ of me concerned in having this child,â€ she persisted to Alvina.
Tuke sent you these roses,â€ said Alvina, putting the flowers through the bars of the gate.
She found Mrs. Tuke wildly clutching the edge of the sheets, and crying: â€œNo, Tommy dear.
Other ships were at seaâ€”destroyers and battleships, grey, low, and sinister on the water.
Ciccio fought in the mob while the porter whisked off Alvina to get seats in the big train.
And at last she was planted once more in a seat, with Ciccioâ€™s place reserved beside her.
And at last, after an eternity, Ciccio came along the platform, the porter trotting behind.

All at once, Chester, who had not expected to see anyone he knew, touched Arthur on the arm.
He thoroughly understands my business, and it would be difficult for me to supply his place.
I should like to see him.â€  The clerk rang a bell and another bell boy made his appearance.
â€œItâ€™s disappeared.â€  â€œWhat was the appearance of the person?â€ persisted Mr. Perkins.
â€œDidnâ€™t Chester look glum when you bounced him?â€  â€œI donâ€™t know and I donâ€™t care.
â€œYes,â€ answered Felix, with rather a disdainful glance at Silas Trippâ€™s rusty garments.

Each of them would have found any suggestion of such a possibility repulsive in the extreme.
Miss Pinnegar kept her thumb on this enterprise, so that it was not much more than abortive.
She says she canâ€™t bear itâ€”she canâ€™t bear the thought of you out there with Alexander.
Glad she would have been to be allowed to treat them quietly and gently, with consideration.

â€œAlbert Witham.â€  â€œAlbert Witham!â€ exclaimed Miss Pinnegar, standing quite motionless.
Thereâ€™s no associations like the old ones.â€ He smiled flatly as he looked towards Alvina.
Both women were so retired, they had heard nothing of Jamesâ€™s little trips down to Lumley.
But stolidly she stared at James, and anxiously she glanced sideways at the pounding Alvina.
When any one particular was coming, he would go to a rather better-class widow in Woodhouse.
It is very kind of her.â€  â€œMiss Houghton is _most_ kindâ€”to _every one_,â€ said Mr. May.
He went straight down to Lumley, and Madame had to remain on tenterhooks till ten oâ€™clock.
Donâ€™t put me to shame, donâ€™t destroy my honour, and the honour of the Natcha-Kee-Tawara.
â€œWell,â€ said Miss Pinnegar, judicious but aloof, â€œitâ€™s a move in the right direction.
There wonâ€™t be room for them in the cabs.â€  â€œWeâ€™ll order another.â€  â€œMore expense.
She never made much of that, did sheâ€”and spent a sight of money on her training, they say.
To one and all Alvina answered with a tantalizing: â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do.
â€œAnd now,â€ said Madame, â€œI shall lock it in my little bank, yes, where it will be safe.
Miss Houghton will come for one month, to prove, and in that time she shall pay for herself.
Geoffrey laid his large hand on her shoulder for a moment, looked into her eyes, and nodded.
Miss Pinnegar said no more, but padded with her tea and her boiled egg into the living room.
After which excitements Geoffrey and Ciccio went in to breakfast, which Alvina had prepared.
And at the back of her mind all the time she wondered at his deliberate recklessness of her.
She took other clothes, adjusted her hair, tied on her apron, and went downstairs once more.
â€œI donâ€™t think I shall be more than an hour.â€  He put on his hat and went out with her.
â€œWell, Miss Houghton, and what news have you?â€  â€œI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve any, Mr. Beeby.
In her own heart she had confidently expected a few hundred pounds: even a thousand or more.
Would you ask her to call about sevenâ€”I think she is free thenâ€”â€  Alvina sat trembling.
She did not want to see Miss Pinnegar, nor the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras: and least of all, Ciccio.
Another day he said to her, when they were talking of age:  â€œYou are as young as you feel.
â€œI wonder where the matron is,â€ said Alvina, suddenly going into the cool white corridor.
She made excursions, she walked on the moors, in the brief but lovely days of early October.
She stood at his side, watching the excited, laughing, noisy, east-end Italians at the desk.
The air in the train was hot, heavy with the crowd and tense with excitement and uneasiness.
For the first time the nostalgia of the vast Roman and classic world took possession of her.
After a while, Pancrazio halted with the ass just ahead, and took the lantern from Giovanni.

She swept it as well as she could, and made a little order in the faggot-heap in the corner.
As a matter of fact Pancrazio had never been rakish or debauched, but mountain-moral, timid.

His masculine mind and intelligence had its home in the little public square of his village.
Somewhere in her soul, she knew the finality of his refusal to hold discussion with a woman.

This grouping of drama, action, and passion as the qualities of great poetry is significant.
In the _Orator_ he considers the orator and the poet as similar in style, but not identical.

Mr. Conrad walked down Broadway with the boys, pointing out any notable buildings on the way.

â€œNow, where shall we go?â€  I will not undertake to describe the route followed by the two.
I understand my business.â€  There was nothing for Chester to do but to accept the dismissal.

She was sitting in an armchair in the room adjoining her chamber, looking pale and sorrowful.
Coleman,â€ said Trimble, with suavity, â€œthis is my wife, Mrs. Trimble.â€  The lawyer bowed.
In spite of the positive testimony he had given he did not even know Edward Granger by sight.
â€œOh, not really.â€ And she gave the arch look with her eyes, which made Miss Frost shudder.
On her own head then if she is made unhappy: for her expectation is arrogant and impertinent.

Miss Frost smiled with her old bright, wonderful look, that had a touch of queenliness in it.
And he took his place at her side along the Knarborough Road, where everybody turned to look.
â€œAnd yet,â€ he admitted slyly, â€œI should _like_ to marryâ€”â€ To this she did not answer.
What I wonder is why they find it such a drawback.â€  â€œFind what a drawback?â€ asked James.
Donâ€™t you agree?â€  Poor James was too bewildered to know whether to agree or not to agree.
â€œIâ€™m quite certain.â€  â€œCock-sure people are often most mistaken,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.
And after this, she was a long time before she forgave Alvina, and was really friendly again.
For her it means failure to live, failure to establish her own life on the face of the earth.
Then there was a short cross-way, up which one saw the iron foundry, a black and rusty place.
_Can_ you imagine such a person?â€  â€œIt must have been trying.â€  â€œI should think it was.
â€œIâ€™m sorry for Madame,â€ said Alvina, as she hurried rather breathless through the night.
Strange fine black hair, he had, close as fur, animal, and naked, frail-seeming, tawny hands.
He laid them down on the bed before her, and took her hand, bowing and kissing it reverently.
To Naples.â€  â€œYes, I shall go back to Italy,â€ he said, as if unwilling to commit himself.
You lookâ€”alsoâ€”what shall I sayâ€”thin, not very happy.â€  It was a note of interrogation.

Her _braves_ became glamorous and heroic at once, and magically she cast her spell over them.
Then they will go when they likeâ€”â€  â€œI will come round to say good-byeâ€”â€ said Alvina.

In the early afternoon came a telegram: Coming both tomorrow morning deepest sympathy Madame.
I havenâ€™t enquired.â€  â€œNo, but you have a good idea, eh?â€  â€œIâ€™m afraid I havenâ€™t.
â€œAll right,â€ he said, and he picked his way across the graves to Madame, following Alvina.
She was rather frail and tender-looking, with wondering eyes that showed she had been crying.
â€œI will go alone,â€ said Alvina, â€œunless you will come, Madame.â€  â€œAlas no, I canâ€™t.
They tried to talk to her, they tried to ingratiate themselvesâ€”but she wasnâ€™t having any.

She preferred Miss Pinnegar, and admired Miss Pinnegarâ€™s humble wisdom with a new admiration.
James Houghton, like an excited beetle, scurried to and fro, feeling he was making his fortune.
The legend attracted him immenselyâ€”as a teetotaller, it had a mysterious, hypnotic influence.
Yet the other woman was sharp and shrewd in the uptake, and for some reason she fancied Alvina.
Thereâ€™s nothing in riding a bicycle.â€  â€œI donâ€™t believe I ever should,â€ laughed Alvina.

When they got back, Madame was light-headed, and talking excitedly of her dance, her young men.
Ciccio was without his blanket, naked to the waist, in war-paint, and brandishing a long spear.
They are like thisâ€”â€ And he made the Neapolitan gesture drawing in the air with his fingers.
â€œDonâ€™t come in,â€ said Alvina to Geoffrey, looking over her shoulder at him as she entered.
What you say?â€  â€œYes,â€ said Ciccio, again looking up at her with his yellow, glinting eyes.
But I donâ€™t want to take them from youâ€”â€  â€œIf I give them, you do not take them from me.
Ciccio put down the things as she directed, and stood with his cap in his hands, looking aside.
â€œDonâ€™t make any more engagements after the end of next month.â€  â€œReally!â€ said Mr. May.
First, could she bear it, when the Endeavour was turned into another cheap and nasty film-shop?
She was in the drawing-room with her cousin, to give the interview its proper air of solemnity.
Involuntarily he turned and lifted his face again towards Alvina, as if studying her curiously.
Madame watched him stonily as she stood beside her chair, one hand lightly balanced on her hip.
Miss Pinnegar, her face stained carmine by the fire, was helping Mrs. Rollings with the dinner.
â€œStop now, since you have stopped for so long,â€ said Madame, darting her black looks at him.
â€œWhen it is said, it has a sound _against_: that is, against the neighbour, against humanity.
Poor Alvina, this was the only day in all her life when she was the centre of public attention.

Perhapsâ€”â€ said Geoffrey, laying his arm on Ciccioâ€™s shoulder, and giving him a sudden hug.
Alvina brought out the cards, and a little box of pence which remained from Endeavour harvests.
Fortunately there were glasses, the best old glasses, in the side cupboard in the drawing room.
â€œBut why father?â€  â€œYou lost girl!â€ said Miss Pinnegar, backing out and closing the door.

But all the othersâ€”why, you see, they are men, and they know which side to butter their bread.
And Alvina did not know whether she was sceptical, or jealous, or admiring, or really impressed.
â€œWe are one tribe, one nationâ€”say it.â€  â€œWe are one tribe, one nation,â€ repeated Alvina.

I dare say he feels poorer than I do.â€  â€œSuch men ought not to have money,â€ growled the tramp.

This elegant Adam of commerce gave Eve her own back, nicely cored, and had no more to do with her.
No French marquis in a Dickensâ€™ novel could have been more elegant and _raffinÃ©_ and heartless.
Meanwhile his wife became more and more an invalid; the little Alvina was a pretty, growing child.
From her room in the shadows at the back the invalid heard the hammering and sawing, and suffered.

Miss Frost wept in anguish, and saw nothing but another woman betrayed to sorrow and a slow death.
Miss Frost lifted her eyes:  â€œThereâ€™s no need,â€ she said, and she smiled winsomely at Alvina.

James seemed for the time being wrapt in his undertakingâ€”particularly in the takings part of it.

â€œBut can the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras afford to pay a pianist for themselves?â€  â€œNo,â€ said Madame.
Madame became paler, her eyes blacker, with the wine she drank, her voice became a little raucous.
â€œThis is the squaw Allaye, this is the daughter of KishwÃ©gin,â€ she said, in her Tawara manner.
â€œNay, lass,â€ said the woman, â€œif you share niver a drop oâ€™ thâ€™ lashins, you mun split it.

â€œI hadna time for owt else.â€ Dr. Mitchell was just stooping his handsome figure in the doorway.

He would teach her to drive, and they would sit side by side, she driving him and waiting for him.
She wondered if the troupe was in England: if they would continue together when Geoffrey was gone.
!â€”prostitutedâ€”â€  â€œPerhaps life itself is something bigger than intelligence,â€ said Alvina.
â€œWhy not _be_ atavistic if you _can_ be, and follow at a manâ€™s heel just because heâ€™s a man.
There was no wonderful intimacy of speech, such as she had always imagined, and always craved for.
And Alvina and Ciccio looked at the sun, which stood a little to the right of the shipâ€™s course.
He was on his feet with his back to the inner window, rolling slightly to the motion of the train.
Alvina, looking out, saw the two unfamiliar engines snorting out their smoke round the bend ahead.
The compartment was full of large, mountain-peasants with black hats and big cloaks and overcoats.
Peering ahead, Alvina thought she saw the hollow between the peaks, which was the top of the pass.
So she would sit on the settle and drink her coffee and milk, into which she dipped her dry bread.

You see thâ€™ bedâ€™s soft, itâ€™s a sort oâ€™ clay-bind, itâ€™s not clunch such as you get deeper.
For truly nothing could be more hideous than Woodhouse, as the miners had built it and disposed it.
What do _you_ think of the scheme?â€  â€œI?â€”wellâ€”!â€ Alvina hesitated, then broke into a laugh.
He wanted powerâ€”and he would creep quietly after it till he got it: as much as he was capable of.
It was Saturday evening, and her father had opened the shop, Miss Pinnegar had gone to Knarborough.
None the less he sallied out with all his old bright perkiness, the next time he had to meet James.

All the time it rained, and his back wheel slipped under him, in the mud and on the new tram-track.
She became something quite different: fresh, virginal, pristine, a magic creature flickering there.
Alvina went to lie down in her fatherâ€™s little, rather chilly chamber at the end of the corridor.
And he kissed her with a finesse, a passionate finesse which seemed like coals of fire on her head.
She turned, slipped past, ran indoors and upstairs to the little bare bedroom she had made her own.
And will you keep on the theatreâ€”with Mr. Mayâ€”?â€  Ciccio was sitting looking towards the fire.

She could see their mouths all smiling, their teeth white as they cried in their throats: â€œVaali!
He gave an odd, half-gay, half-mocking twitch of his thick dark brows, and began to laugh silently.
And then there was a kissing and a taking of farewells, as if the company were separating for ever.
A fair number of Woodhouse young people were strolling along the pavements in their Sunday clothes.
â€œWe couldnâ€™t take it, could we?â€  â€œEvery penny shows in the books.â€  Alvina pondered again.

So he mercifully left her alone: he was on the whole devoutly thankful she wanted to be left alone.
But now something unfolded in him, he was a potent, glamorous presence, people turned to watch him.
There were many people at the Consulate, clamouring for passportsâ€”a wild and ill-regulated crowd.

Two days later Chester was walking through Union Square when he came face to face with Felix Gordon.
I like to be appreciated by somebody.â€  At the dinner table Chester was introduced to Prof. Nugent.
I should like nothing better.â€  The next afternoon Chester chanced to enter the Fifth Avenue Hotel.
â€œDo you see that man?â€ he asked, pointing to a black-bearded man on the other side of the street.
Let me introduce my friend, Chester Rand.â€  â€œGlad to meet you, Mr. Rand,â€ said Wilson, heartily.
â€œI donâ€™t know him.â€  â€œHow do you explain this, Mr. Floyd?â€ asked Mrs. Trimble, suspiciously.
But it so happened that Chester himself came into the store in five minutes, and confirmed the news.

Then occasionally there was a magic lantern or a penny reading, to which Miss Frost accompanied her.
You would be entirely unprotected.â€  â€œI donâ€™t mind being unprotected,â€ said Alvina perversely.
To her it seemed so shallow and heartless, with terms of endearment stuck in like exclamation marks.
But the curious insolence which sometimes came out in the girl was inherited direct from her father.
As Alvina sat motionless in the train, running from Woodhouse to Tibshelf, it decided itself in her.
She was very glad that Alvina had returned to take this responsibility of nursing off her shoulders.
The universe should be something else, and not what it is: so the nonsense of idealistic conclusion.
The two were talking of Dr. Headley, who, they read in the newspaper, had disgraced himself finally.

That was what it had come to, with Jamesâ€™s declining fortunes: she was merely _considered_ a lady.

There was a fat porker and a fat pork-pie, and the pig was saying: â€œYou all know where to find me.
I believe theyâ€™re jealous.â€  â€œOh nonsense!â€ exploded Mr. May, starting as if he had been shot.
â€œYou see,â€ said Madame to Alvina, â€œthey are very funny, these young men, particularly Italians.
I think weâ€™ve done very well, in face of difficulties, donâ€™t you?â€  â€œWonderfully,â€ she said.
No more?â€  â€œA hundred and twentyâ€”â€  â€œWhere is it?â€  â€œIn my bag at the stationâ€”in notes.
And Iâ€™ve got a little hereâ€”â€ Alvina opened her purse, and took out some little gold and silver.
They had horribly low standardsâ€”such low standardsâ€”not only of morality, but of life altogether.
And Alvina, as she sat beside him, was reminded of the woman with the negro husband, down in Lumley.
The breach between her and them was established for everâ€”and it was her will which established it.
So they played on, till Mr. May and Geoffrey had won all the pennies, except twopence of Ciccioâ€™s.
Ciccio held up his glass, looked at Alvina, made a little mouth at her, comical, and drank his beer.
How are you going to ride to Mansfield, hein?â€”great beast.â€  â€œCiccio,â€ said Geoffrey solemnly.
I shall go away, anyhow.â€  â€œYou will go away?â€ said the lawyer, and he studied his finger-nails.
The pianoâ€”even motherâ€™s portraitâ€”â€  â€œItâ€™s impossible to believe it,â€ said Miss Pinnegar.

He was building a little earth closet also: the obvious and unscreened place outside was impossible.
She understood also why he was so glad to have her in his house, so proud, why he loved serving her.
There would sometimes be a strange passivity on his worn face, an impassive, almost Red Indian look.
To tell the truth, she was happy in the quietness with Ciccio, now they had their own pleasant room.
I canâ€™t stay here very long without you.â€  â€œYou will have Pancrazioâ€”and the child,â€ he said.

I suppose you havenâ€™t any houses like that in Wyncombe?â€  â€œOh, no.â€  â€œWe will turn down here.
Chester stopped short in dismay, and an expression of pain succeeded the gay look on Arthurâ€™s face.

Alvina got on better with his wife, who watched closely to learn from her guest the secret of repose.
He was tall and thin and brittle, with a pale, rather dry, flattish face, and with curious pale eyes.

â€œYou donâ€™t find that the new connections make up for the old?â€  â€œNot altogether, they donâ€™t.

She stared for many hours at the light of the street-lamp, and there was a narrowed look in her eyes.
I donâ€™t mean anything by them.â€  â€œOh, as for that,â€ he said, taking the words out of her mouth.
Alvina fell again into humility and fear: she began to show symptoms of her motherâ€™s heart trouble.

Ciccio leaned with his arms on his knees, looking sideways under his long lashes at the inert Alvina.
Do you feel they appreciate your work as much as they did?â€  Madame watched him with her black eyes.
But Louis was determined also, he wrestled as fiercely as Max, and at last the latter began to yield.
â€œWhy, Max, why didst thou not remain man enough to control that insulting mountain temper of thine.
My heart is with you, my dear.â€ She put her arms round Alvina and kissed her, a little theatrically.
Alvina had about a hundred pounds left from the insurance money, when all funeral expenses were paid.

Youâ€™re all right, ma wench, youâ€™re all rightâ€”â€  And the rather bleary woman went nodding away.
The sound penetrated her like a thread of fire, hurting, but delicious, the high thread of his voice.
â€œShe sat here for years, in this chair.â€  â€œAlways here?â€ he said, looking into Alvinaâ€™s face.
â€œIâ€™m putting my things into my two trunks, and I shall just ask Mrs. Slaney to store them for me.
Youâ€™re always knocked down.â€  â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter,â€ said Alvina, â€œif itâ€™s only in the end.
â€œWhy your barrow-load of cucumbers.â€  â€œOh,â€ said the man, scrutinizing his cucumbers carefully.
â€œWhen will they learn intelligence?â€ he said to Alvina, smiling and showing his white, even teeth.
â€œVery weak, please.â€  The doctor was a little laboured in his gallantry, but unmistakably gallant.
â€œI shall put my cap straight.â€ And she went to the mirror, fluffing her hair and settling her cap.
And my mind doesnâ€™tâ€”yet there it is!â€ She spread her fine hands with a flicker of inevitability.
But we want to be serenaded, donâ€™t we, nurse?â€”â€  Alvina stood at her window, but did not answer.
Then she took a little luggage, told the people of her house she would be back next day, and set off.
Her thoughts were dim, in the dim back regions of consciousnessâ€”yet, somewhere, she almost exulted.
Somewhere even she was vastly proud of the dark veiled eternal loneliness she felt, under his shadow.
The sun was fairly high in the open sky, where white cloud-tops showed against the pale, wintry blue.
A fat Italian hotel-keeper put on a smoking cap, covered the light, and spread himself before Alvina.
She felt vaster influences spreading around, the Past was greater, more magnificent in these regions.

It will be because you donâ€™t want to.â€  â€œWho told you so?â€ he asked, with the same cruel smile.
Many modern critics have found the classical distinction between rhetoric and poetic very suggestive.
Movement is characteristic of poetry, as color and form are characteristic of painting and sculpture.

Plutarch in his essay _On the Reading of Poets_, is much more representative of late Greek criticism.
From line 99 to line 288, Horace devotes his attention to the rules governing the writing of tragedy.

Palmieri, in his _Della Vita Civile_ (1435), defines rhetoric as the theory of speaking ornamentally.
The Greek text was first published in the Aldine _Rhetores Graeci_ (1508)[176] badly edited by Ducas.
The rhetorics of Cox (1524) and Wilson (1553) were rhetorics and made no pretence of treating poetry.
It is interesting, however, that Sidney's influence did not at once dislodge the mediaeval tradition.

â€œI must tell Dr. Gridley of this new manifestation on the part of my poor boy,â€ said the professor.
Before he knew what was going to happen, Chester received a light tap on the nose from his new friend.
They got off at one of the upper floors, and Chester followed his guide to the door of a room near by.
Why didnâ€™t you take it and stay with them?â€  â€œBecause he gave it to me expressly for the theater.
When he entered the office, Mullins demanded, sharply, â€œWhat made you so long?â€  Chester explained.
Mr. Sharpleigh listened attentively to Chesterâ€™s communication, and then proceeded to ask questions.
â€œI will speak to uncle Edgar, and he will arrange to have you come four times a week instead of two.

She reserved her own modest share, paid the expenses of her department, and left the residue to James.
James Houghton, however, was seized with a desire to work the Connection Meadow seam, as he called it.
She spoke of theatres and music-halls with these young men, and the jolly good time she had with them.
She would have had to take him between her hands and caress and cajole him like a cherub, into a fall.
He merely took another circuit, and rose another flight higher on the spiral of his spiritual egotism.
She would involve and lead a man on, she would destroy him rather than not get of him what she wanted.
The man was quite nicely dressed, in the regulation tweed jacket and flannel trousers and brown shoes.
â€œThatâ€™s a nice rotten pair of steps youâ€™ve got up there for a death-trap,â€ said Arthur angrily.
This was a grand scoop for James: not a penny was it going to cost him, and the rent was clear profit.
â€œWho _ever_ can that common-looking man be?â€ said Miss Pinnegar, her heart going down to her boots.
Did ever you see such a pink face?â€  â€œ_And_ the braid binding!â€ said Miss Pinnegar in indignation.
James fluttered into conversation with his daughter the next evening, after Miss Pinnegar had retired.
â€œDonâ€™t you think,â€ he said to her, â€œitâ€™s an admirable scheme?â€  â€œWonderful,â€ she replied.
If he had seen the least sign of coming-on-ness in her, he would have fluttered off in a great dither.
â€œBut how is itâ€”â€ he attacked Arthur Withamâ€”â€œthat the gas isnâ€™t connected with the main yet?
Alvina had to open the performance by playing an overture called â€œWelcome Allâ€: a ridiculous piece.
He was waiting now for the trams, and building up hopes since he could not build in bricks and mortar.
The room was small, rather bare, with horse-hair and white-crochet antimacassars and a linoleum floor.
I had a hundred and five when we were in Redruth.â€  Alvina had taken the thermometer from her pocket.

Yes.â€  So the two women returned to Woodhouse by the tram-car, while Ciccio rode home on his bicycle.
On Sunday the party would leave for Warsall, about thirty miles away, to fulfil their next engagement.
He was waiting: silent there, with something muscular and remote about his very droop, he was waiting.
All will be much more difficultâ€”â€  â€œOh, I will tell him in time,â€ said Alvina, pale at the lips.

Bah, with their trousers turned up to their knees it was enough for them to wet their toes in the dangerous sea.
The two Miss Carlins, two more old maids, had made themselves ridiculous for ever by becoming twin cycle fiends.

He came forward lifting his hat with a smiling and familiar â€œGood evening!â€  â€œGood evening,â€ she murmured.
Luckily, when he had had the shirts made he had secured enough material for the renewing of cuffs and neckbands.
There was an army of fat pennies, a dozen to a column, along the back, rows and rows of fat brown rank-and-file.
CHAPTER VII NATCHA-KEE-TAWARA   Mr. May and Alvina became almost inseparable, and Woodhouse buzzed with scandal.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were due in the third week in January, arriving from the Potteries on the Sunday evening.
Till Thursday, then, KishwÃ©gin does not exist.â€  And she subsided, already rather weak, upon her pillow again.
And he was horribly uncomfortable, walking there beside Alvina with his rather small and effeminately-shod feet.
â€œOh, good-morning, Madame, so glad to see you downstairs,â€ he said, taking her hand and bowing ceremoniously.
â€œCanâ€™t we put it on?â€  â€œNo,â€ drawled Madame, â€œit was nothingâ€”just a non-sensical mood of the moment.
â€œWe had best go home and speak to Madame,â€ said Mr. May, who was very frightened for his evening performance.
Ciccio laughed in a strange way, as he wrestled with the bear, as he had never laughed on the previous evenings.
Here are the things you broughtâ€”â€ Madame indicated a little pileâ€”â€œand thank you _very_ much, _very_ much.

â€œWhat have you said to Miss Houghton?â€ she said suddenly to Ciccio, tackling him direct, and speaking coldly.
â€œThis is just like him, to be soâ€”soâ€”â€ Madame could not express herself as she walked down to the kitchen.
Mr. May looked even more distant, drawing himself up in an odd fashion, so that he looked as if he were trussed.
James had left everything to his daughter, excepting some rights in the work-shop, which were Miss Pinnegarâ€™s.
He was awful to her, shameless so that she died under his shamelessness, his smiling, progressive shamelessness.
Alvina, emerging from a draperâ€™s shop in Rotherhampton Broadway, found them loitering on the pavement outside.

She felt strange in Woodhouse, almost as if the ground had risen from under her feet and hit her over the mouth.
I know she canâ€™t bear me already, for all the fuss and upset I cause.â€  Ciccio rose slowly, wiping his mouth.
She rather looked forward to leaving the Town Hall, hurrying to take her bag and off to the station and freedom.
â€œSometimes,â€ said the matron, â€œwomen are charmed to be intruded upon.â€  â€œOh really!â€ his eyes sparkled.

Pancrazio was the well-to-do uncle, who had been a model and had built a â€œvilla.â€ Giovanni was not much good.
There was evidently not too much intimacy between the people of Pescocalascio and these semi-townfolk of Ossona.
Alvina crossed rather tremulous, followed by Pancrazio with the light, and Ciccio with the bread and the valise.
Ciccio rose early, and went about in the hap-hazard, useless way of Italians all day long, getting nothing done.

So he soared to serene heights, and his Private Hotel seemed a celestial injunction, an erection on a higher plane.

Itâ€™s just the work that has ruined my digestion, the never getting a quiet meal, and never a whole nightâ€™s rest.
And then he gave her tea in the drawing-room, with strawberries and cream and cakes, of all of which he ate nothing.
Alvina was admitted to these teas with the few women who formed the toney intellectual Ã©lite of this northern town.
â€œ_Ma non me lasciare_â€”_Donâ€™t leave me!_ There, isnâ€™t that it?â€  He smiled, stirred on his feet, and nodded.

But there was no shop, no post nearer than Pescocalascio, an hourâ€™s heavy road up deep and rocky, wearying tracks.

Poetry, he says, contains great and profitable fruits for the instruction of manners and precepts of good life[400].
And he finds much profit even in the most dissolute works of Ovid and Martial because they abound in moral precepts.
Poetry has, he believes, a moral effect, but he does not establish this moral effect as its motivating purpose[402].

Prithee, _Sharp_, if thou canst learn that young Thingâ€™s Name, â€˜tis a pretty airy Rogue, whilst I go talk to her.

Ay, thatâ€™s it that appeases her highest Storms--here, my Jewel, hereâ€™s a hundred Guineas to buy thee fine things.
By no means, we must make use of him whilst he is hot; for I doubt the Humour is not natural, and I fear he may cool.
Look ye, _Sharp_, take to thee an implicit Faith, and believe Impossibilities; for thou and I must cozen this Knight.
that has abusâ€™d the best of all my Hopes!--No, I think--I shall grow (for his sake) to hate all that belong to him.
Yes, that _Diana_, Whom, maugre all the Penitence thou shewâ€™st, Can scarce forgive the Injuries thou hast done her.

The Worldâ€™s well amended with him, Captain, since I lost my Money to him and you at the _George_ in _White-Fryers_.
Oh Lord, Madam, you oblige me--look, _Ned_, you had a mind to have a full view of my Mistress, Sir, and--here she is.
--But see she comes--      _Enter Lady_ Fulbank, _Sir_ Cautious, _Sir_ Feeble,     Leticia, Bearjest, Noisey, Gayman.
--But I think â€˜tis all one to thee, thou carâ€™st not for my Complement; no, thouâ€™dst rather have a young Fellow.

He does not teach now, but, I believe, delivers an annual course of lectures before the students of Columbia College.
If youâ€™ll only wait a little while, sirâ€”â€”â€  â€œHow long have you been paying rent here?â€ asked Mr. Fairchild.
Conrad, an artistâ€”just now, but I shall soon get a boarding place.â€  â€œI live on Eighty-sixth Streetâ€”in a flat.
Mr. Mullins is thoroughly acquainted with my business, but within the last six months I found myself distrusting him.
Have you a boy workinâ€™ for you named Chesterâ€”Chester Rand?â€  â€œAre you a friend of his?â€ asked the bookkeeper.
Mine only cost thirty dollars each.â€  â€œI shall begin to look upon you as a rich man, Chester,â€ said Arthur Burks.

When they came to the rather stumbly railway, he said:  â€œWonâ€™t you take my arm?â€â€”offering her the said member.
She wondered if any one would ask him to supperâ€”bread and cheese and currant-loaf, and water, was all that offered.
â€œCould you tell me where I can find out about it, anyway?â€ Mr. May used his most affable, man of the world manner.
Woodhouse could not believe that Mr. May was absolutely final in his horror of any sort of coming-on-ness in a woman.
But if itâ€™s my appearance, tell me so.â€  Here an appalling figure of Ciccio in war-paint strolled on to the stage.
She smiled into his softening round eyes, the eyes of some animal which stares in one of its silent, gentler moments.
His long, fine nose, his rather long, rounded chin and curling lips seemed refined through ages of forgotten culture.
Alvina had avoided Madame as Ciccio had avoided Alvinaâ€”elusive and yet conscious, a distance, and yet a connection.
Well, I must thank you once moreâ€”â€  â€œWhat time do you leave in the morning?â€  â€œBy the train at half-past ten.

And _youâ€™ll_ have to bother before youâ€™ve done.â€  â€œSufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,â€ said Alvina.
You are a pessimist with regard to human nature.â€  â€œAm I?â€ smiled Alvina, thinking the rose would smell as sweet.
She, of course, when he began to admire her, liked him much better, and even saw graceful, boyish attractions in him.

(23) No town or person shall be forced to build bridges over rivers except those with an ancient obligation to do so.
Renaissance English writers on the theory of poetry use to an extent hitherto unexplored the terminology of rhetoric.
And though both verse and oratorical prose should be rhythmical, a set rhythm, a meter, is appropriate only to verse.
In the anonymous, _The Artes of Logike and Rhetorike_ (1584),[145] rhetoric is denned as an arte of speaking finelie.

And as she gasped, he quite gently put her inside her room, and closed the door, keeping one arm round her all the time.
She could see the Adamâ€™s apple move in his throat, his brows tilted as he looked along his lashes at her all the time.
We mustnâ€™t prolong our cheerfulness _too_ far.â€  â€œCiccio is staying to help me with my bag tomorrow,â€ said Alvina.

All those other peasant women, did they feel as she did?â€”the same sort of acquiescent passion, the same lapse of life?
Alvina felt that if she were left much alone with him she would need all her English ascendancy not to be afraid of him.

It seems almost incredible that a sketch which he had dashed off in twenty minutes should bring in such a magnificent sum.
No, mother, I will never serve Silas Tripp again.â€  â€œThere might be some other chance.â€  â€œBut there isnâ€™t, mother.
By the way, I heard at the post office that the shoe manufactory will open again in three weeks.â€  â€œThatâ€™s good news.

Mr. Mullins, on seeing him, laid aside his unpleasant manner, and said, in a matter-of-fact tone:  â€œThis is Mrs. Carlin.
Mr. Mullins, give Mrs. Carlin a receipt on account, and she will pay the balance as soon as she can.â€  â€œThank you, sir.
What does he say now?â€  â€œHe doesnâ€™t know that the receipt is found.â€  â€œHow is that?â€ asked the mechanic, puzzled.
One evening last week, I saw him going into Dalyâ€™s Theatre with a young fellow handsomely dressedâ€”quite a young swell.

The father had left each of his sons a fair little sum of money, which Arthur, the eldest, had already increased ten-fold.
â€œYes, Iâ€™ve been it once or twiceâ€”with girls that are all married now.â€  â€œDidnâ€™t you want to marry?â€ she asked.
â€œBut if a man never knows his own mind, he certainly canâ€™t be much of a man.â€  â€œI donâ€™t see it,â€ replied Albert.
She had a last view of Arthur stooping over his precious leg, while Calladine stooped his length and held down the candle.
We are in peril of our lives from them: and in peril of our souls too, for they would damn us one and all to the ordinary.
Good-morning.â€  Mr. Mayâ€™s quick eye, roving round, had seen a negro stoop from under the canvas that covered one booth.
He was one of those men who carry themselves in a birdie fashion, so that their tail sticks out a little behind, jauntily.
In her spare time Alvina sat in the ladiesâ€™ dressing room, or in its lower doorway, for there was not room right inside.
She saw the menâ€™s feet, in their shabby pumps, on the other side of the curtain, and she heard the menâ€™s gruff voices.
James ceased to wave his penny-blackened hands, Alvina struck up â€œWelcome Allâ€ as loudly and emphatically as she could.
His curious soft slouch, and curious way of lifting his lip from his white teeth, in a sort of smile, was very convincing.
He went the round of associates known and unknown, of lodgings strange and familiar, of third-rate possible public houses.
As he pressed in the long darkness that lay between Slaters Mill and Durbeyhouses, he saw a light aheadâ€”another cyclist.
I will send Ciccio with themâ€”or one of the othersâ€”â€  â€œI should like to say good-bye to you all,â€ persisted Alvina.
Donâ€™t bother.â€ So he sat with his head on his hand in the box-office, and Mr. May had to leave him to operate the film.
She sat in horror and apprehension, her eyebrows raised, starting and looking at James in terror whenever he made a noise.
But I have seenâ€”â€ Alvina watched with wide, troubled eyes, while Madame darted looks, as from bright, deep black glass.
He never wore black, and was very unhappy in it, being almost morbidly sensitive to the impression the colour made on him.
Whether she was herself or not, in the hideous, common, stuffy sitting-room of the lodging-house she did not know or care.
Dark, he sat beside her, drawn in to himself, overcast by his presumed inferiority among these northern industrial people.
And it seemed, in spite of all, one state was very much the same to him as another, poverty was as much life as affluence.
Whereupon Geoffrey immediately flopped on his knees again before Alvina, and presented her his broad, rich-coloured cheek.
He was about fifty-four years old, tall, largely-built, with a good figure, but with extraordinarily large feet and hands.
But he saw a half-frightened, half-guilty look on her face, and during the weeks of anticipation he had worked himself up.
And so he craved for marriage: to possess her entirely, and to have her always there with him, so that he was never alone.

After two days in Angora we diverged from the direct route to Sivas through YÃ¼zgat, so as to visit the city of Kaisarieh.
At Koch-Hissar, on our way from Sivas to Kara Hissar, a delay was caused by a rather serious break in one of our bicycles.

And she laughed and squirmed a little, so that they felt all the more her warmth and softness under their armâ€™s pressure.
Surely Clarissâ€™ heart-disease was a more emphatic sign of obstinate self-importance than ever Jamesâ€™ shop-windows were.
When she met him in the street she would stop himâ€”though he was always busyâ€”and make him exchange a few words with her.

There was one tall young fellow with a red face and fair hair, who looked as if he had fronted the seas and the arctic sun.

James Houghton complained of Fortune, yet to what other man would Fortune have sent two such women as Miss Frost and Miss Pinnegar, _gratis_?

Ciccio, who was the crack horseman, having served a very well-known horsey Marchese in an Italian cavalry regiment, did a bit of show riding.
But Alvina caught the slow, mischievous smile as the painted horror showed his teeth in passing; she was able to flash back an excited laugh.
To which home and home life Alvina now clung with a desperate yearning, knowing inevitably she was going to lose it, now her father was gone.
â€œAlley or avenue, what does it matter,â€ cried Madame in French, â€œso long as it is a good journey.â€  Here Geoffrey at last saw the joke.
Then she lightly kissed him on the cheek, and said:  â€œWonâ€™t you go to bed and sleep?â€  Geoffrey staggered to his feet, shaking his head.
