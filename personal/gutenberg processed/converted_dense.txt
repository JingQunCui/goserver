Pleasant this--Well, _Frank_, I do--And what then?
I say, let me no more see thee approach this Lady.
--But pray, how long, Sir, have you lov’d me so?
Come, give me your Vows, or we must part for ever.
Why, Sir--what think you of debauching his Sister?
And you, _Frank_, will you marry my Niece _Diana_?
Well, and what do you intend to do, if it be, Sir?
_Enter_ Bellmour, _Sir_ Timothy, Sham _and_ Sharp.

Hey, Rogues, Rascals, Boys, follow me just behind.
Ah, nothing but a great gilt Coach will become it.
Oh, nothing is so ventrous as Love, if it be true.

My Lord the Prince, what makes your Highness here?
--Where dost thou mean, bad Man, to hide thy head?
Why, Sir, do you think there can indeed be Ghosts?

Well, Sir, your business, for mine requires haste.

CHESTER’S FIRST EXPERIENCES IN NEW YORK     XII.
“I ain’t rich, said Silas Tripp, cautiously.
“Yes, I had to part with my overcoat long since.
Silas Tripp has a small soul, hardly worth saving.
“I want everything to be legal, resumed Bruce.
If you     have any others ready, send them along.
“You’ve got a tidy little place here, ma’am.
“I wonder where he’s going, thought Chester.
Don’t you go for to run away.  Chester smiled.
“I say, there’s the tramp now, he exclaimed.
“Does Mr. James Long live here? asked Chester.
He says that he left it behind in the office here.
“I think I’ll go to Daly’s Theater to-night.
He was shown at once into the professor’s study.
“May I come in, uncle? he asked, with a smile.
Would you like to see him?  Chester shrank back.
“Did you come to see me? asked Ernest, softly.
But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.
“Who are you? asked the astonished bookkeeper.
“Yes, he answered, “he arrived last evening.
“I bring you an invitation to dinner, he said.
“Only a rich boy, corrected Chester, laughing.
“Am I to arrest this man? asked the policeman.
“There’s a great row at the office, he said.
On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon.
Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant.
Will you go over with me to Mr. Taylor’s office?
“Good-evening, Mr. Mullins, he said, politely.
He had not been aware that his stepson could swim.
A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble.
“Good-evenin’, widder, said Silas, coughing.
Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.
Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.
In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.
She was not particularly religious by inclination.
It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.
She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.
But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.
Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.
Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.
Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.
Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?
So both alike were defeated in their expectations.
For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.
Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.
There was no spontaneous interchange between them.
We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.
It all seemed really too funny to her—too funny.
What’s that for? asked Lottie Witham shrewdly.
But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.
But it was Arthur who came out into communication.
“You won’t _say_ you are, interposed Arthur.
He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.
There isn’t more than a minute’s fixing to do.
“It’ll wash out, he said, frightened of her.
“I must go home.  “Why, what’s your hurry!
Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.
And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.
I’m afraid he will have to do that part himself.
“Mushrooms—most beautiful things in the world.
The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.
The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.
For she did not find him at all physically moving.
Although you smile.  Alvina did more than smile.
I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.
And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.
Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.
“I don’t think you can see at all, she said.
There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.
All alike! Madame subsided fretfully and weakly.
The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.
But Mr. May was a little too frisky as Kishwégin.
And now they think they’ve done it all, you see.
A tidy man, _I_ say.  He did not look at Alvina.
You know they’re only men dressed up, for money.
Of course you wouldn’t be a good business woman.
Mr. May enjoyed himself hugely playing Kishwégin.
“Let us see.  Max now moved his arm with pain.
Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.
Ciccio! he yelled, dropping off his own bicycle.
Wants thee to come back.  Ciccio shook his head.
Come with me, because I haven’t all my strength.
“Te voilà donc! she said, without expression.
“Sure, he said slowly, with subtle intonation.
And I don’t want to rob Natcha-Kee-Tawara, do I?
She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.
He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.
She looked back at him, as from across a distance.
And I warrant they’ll want to be at the funeral.
But all the time she was uttering her condolences.
Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.
He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.
Ay, if she had her rights she’d be a rich woman.
Ay, when she thinks she’s hooked on to somebody.
She tried to think of Madame’s slow enunciation.
“All right, he said, shaking her hand loosely.
“All right, he said, ducking and turning away.
Chianti—hein?  They all bowed above the table.
It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.
“I shall go and look at the town, said Alvina.
“You will come with me to Woodhouse? she said.
Come on bicycle with me.  Ciccio shook his head.
There were other people in the carriage with them.
She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.
Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.
What a blow you give me!  “Why? said Alvina.
“Oh! perked Mr. May, yellow with strange rage.
“Now.  For a second, she struggled frenziedly.
For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.
She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.
“It’s not more than I expected, said Alvina.
Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.
“Let us wait, and see.  She took it smilingly.
So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.
And if not?  The two women looked at each other.
Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.
The medical board were charming to her—charming.
She could begin tomorrow—but she had no uniform.
Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.
And the next time I ask you, you’ll let me know.
But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.
Perfectly horrible!  “Well, said the matron.
They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.
Then in the drive she picked up Effie’s flowers.
I can understand a little Italian— She paused.
Oh—! She was wild and sweating with her pains.
But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.
He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.
Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.
Piace?  “Do you like it, interpreted Ciccio.
Of course, I knew molto, from, music, she added.
“Have you brought food?  “No, said Ciccio.
But there—a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.
And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.
This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.
Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.
I shall go to England.  He watched her narrowly.
“What is it? she said, laying her hand on him.
“I can’t come back. She heard it so fatally.
She blew out the light, that she need not see him.
The Welsh shall treat us and ours in the same way.

How, are you not to marry his Daughter, _Isabella_?

As any Man in _Cadiz_, Sir, with good instructions.

But you must study to refine your Manners a little.

And how far is that from _Cadiz_?--but what care I?
Ay, Sir, to guard his Mistresses, ‘tis an honour.
Take her, young Man, and with it both your Ransoms.
Am not I in the Possession of _Turks_ and Infidels?
Nay, dear sometimes have bought the Frippery stuff.

I do, and therefore trust my little wants with you.
So may your change of Mistress do me, Sir--farewel.
Is’t possible, Sir, you cou’d devise such News?
This is the most excellent revenge I ever heard of.
So, put it into my Cabinet,--safe, _Francis_, safe.
Fortune and Love invite you, if you dare follow me.
Sir _Feeble Fainwou’d!_--rise,--are you both mad?
Hah--see, by Heaven _Leticia_, Oh, we are ruin’d!
Wrong not my Brother so, who dies for you--  _Dia_.
Take Courage, Madam--you guess right--be confident.
I dare say neither of us were ever that way gifted.

There he is again with his damn’d hard Questions.
Came you, most reverend Bards, from the Moon World?
It was Ketch who bungled the execution of Monmouth.
On the whole, things did not look very encouraging.
He was shocked by Silas Tripp’s want of humanity.
She looked up in surprise at her son’s companion.
“I don’t think I care much for life, he said.
You found the whisky here.  Ramsay made no reply.
I won’t get too much elated, for it may not last.
“I will go up to Mr. Conrad’s room, said Rob.
“Now, he said, “I had better do the ordering.
“I know of Prof. Hazlitt, though I never met him.
“Who’s that boy? he inquired, in a low voice.
You will find pencils and drawing paper before you.
The city I represent is a smart one and no mistake.
What will you do?  “I have some money saved up.
With twenty-five dollars a week he would feel rich.
This question will be answered in the next chapter.
It was not often that Silas Tripp went to New York.
He saw that the bait was likely to prove effective.
“Oh, you mean the real estate office, she said.
He was getting on fast with the professor’s work.
“I will bear in mind what you say, he answered.
When did Mr. Fairchild return?  “This forenoon.
Make careful inquiries as to the value of property.
I don’t think a man of your age would deceive me.
“Of course I brought him here, growled Trimble.
Her father tended to a supercilious, sneering tone.
It was curiosity, deep, radical, burning curiosity.
“But where do you want to go? asked Miss Frost.
Miss Frost’s right hand beat like a wounded bird.
“Then we must think about it, she said, numbly.
But the new and recalcitrant Vina still shone hard.
“Thank you, said Alvina, and the girl departed.
What ought James Houghton to have done differently?
He would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever.
Wherever he was, his wife was a hundred miles away.
Getting on all right?  “Fair, said the woman.
When would he be able to get an advance from James?
I couldn’t think of it.  “Then name a figure.
He wrote various letters and drew up certain notes.
The shop isn’t worth while, said Miss Pinnegar.
It’s a mercy Miss Frost and your mother are dead.
He was terribly secretive with respect to business.
I know we are.  Mr. May looked down in the mouth.
You couldn’t get excited about it: not as a rule.
The trams, moreover, would begin to run in January.
“These are my family of young men, said Madame.
Que ferez-vous, mes pauvres, sans votre Kishwégin.
Alvina hurried indoors, and the young man followed.
What a white-skinned, soft, plump child she seemed!
Alvina practised the music Madame carried with her.
“Yes, you’re wonderful, said Alvina, choking.
Yet she felt convinced of his ultimate good-nature.
Helpless, inert she lay, in her orgasm of laughter.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras all sat with straight faces.
Then what future have you? said Mr. May gloomily.
Ah, this Woodhouse, a curse is on it, I know it is.
Then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction.
You must never let them think you have caught them.
Still she smiled at him, and still he gave no sign.
But she could not make out what his watching meant.
He was a little bit repellent and brutal, inverted.
She loved them so much, she wanted to be with them.
He could not interrupt Alvina, nor the performance.
“Father, she said, shaking his shoulder gently.
“Can you manage? cried Alvina, showing a light.
Mr. May came in, and stayed for a dismal half-hour.
“I should like him to come, said Alvina simply.
And if he will still have you, then you must think.
“You return to the funeral? said Madame coldly.
“Buy Miss Houghton out— said Madame shrewdly.
He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood.
Everything he’s got’s mortgaged up to the hilt.
Alvina broke away from her cousin, and went to him.
“Tell me what _you_ think, she said repeatedly.
Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.
“And how is everything at Woodhouse? she asked.
And after all, Woodhouse wasn’t fifty miles away.
The young men had been out shopping for the supper.
Yes? she added, with her subtle, malicious smile.
“Please don’t get up, she said to the others.
“I don’t want to stay here, anyhow, she said.
Pas pour moi!  And they went laughing downstairs.
But I’m afraid we shall have a rather _dry_ game?
“I shall sell out of the Endeavour.  “Really!
“And have you told Miss Pinnegar? said Mr. May.
Alvina looked at Ciccio, who stood above, watching.
And quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire.
You might come to the lawyer’s with me, will you?
“You’ll be there at seven o’clock? he said.
“But you’re all right, yourself, Miss Pinnegar.
It’s all shown in my books, said Miss Pinnegar.
The cordiality, the _joie de vivre_ did not revive.
“To look at the papers and magazines.  “Ha-a!
Every one is most kind, and I feel at home already.
“Fower per cent., mimicked the doctor brutally.
And I know that those things cause me half my work.
“Oh yes, I intend to, he said, with confidence.
But wondering about the Natchas would not help her.
She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.
His face was blind with anger, like a hot, red sun.
And both of us, since we are now one, he replied.
Next month, at the latest.  “Oh no, she said.
“My flesh isn’t concerned, and my mind isn’t.
“Oh, the flesh is a _beastly_ thing! she cried.
But she found Ciccio leaning against a gate-pillar.
It’s horrible—  “Well, it’s not my fault.
Come with me, Allaye.  She could not look at him.
She was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself.
But her chest was raw, she felt weak and miserable.
Ciccio too was feasted, in the dark hole of a room.
The old crone said something unintelligible to her.
Don’t wait for me! he cried, his voice muffled.
At times other, honey scents wafted from the hills.

“You find it so, do you! returned Miss Pinnegar.
He could not bear the sudden acute hurt to his shin.
“It would be all the same if I did, said Alvina.
“It’s no more easy to understand, said Alvina.
He had been in America, out West, doing shows there.
How wonderfully the satin of his waistcoat had worn!
And the two men came to no agreement _that_ morning.
And the address, please?  “I dunno th’ street.
“I believe he has, said Miss Pinnegar pensively.
I like a little yellow turnip, said Miss Pinnegar.
But it’s so different with the mental friendships.
And _then_—she nearly set the stools on top of me.
“I can’t believe they want nothing but pictures.
Odd, eccentric people they were, these entertainers.
“I’ll run round for the doctor— said Alvina.
Best leave me.  “Let me help you, said Alvina.
“Won’t you all go downstairs now? said Alvina.
The prisoner is tripped up—falls, and cannot rise.
Her impulse was to turn and go away from the stable.
I _couldn’t_.  Madame nodded slowly up and down.
“Englishwomen, said Madame, “are so practical.
Suddenly Louis started and held up a warning finger.
“I begin to wonder if I have mistaken my vocation.
They want it all through the eye, and finished—so!
But Ciccio it put into unholy, ungovernable tempers.
“These Italians, said Louis, turning to Mr. May.
Geoffrey smiled sheepishly, and his colour deepened.
The young men were moving about making preparations.
“I’m awfully sorry you are going, said Alvina.
He brought them before.  “But I will carry them.
“Do you want? he said, as if waiting for orders.
Even Ciccio she regarded as only one of the Natchas.
She forgot the question in others that occupied her.
“I’m all right, he said, in a brittle fashion.
“Father’s ill! she announced to Miss Pinnegar.
Worn out! Madame said, nodding slowly up and down.
You are his property, when you marry by Italian law.
Madame turned to look at the unhappy, elderly woman.
And then she had the satisfaction of sizing them up.
Look, there’s room for Alvina’s name underneath.
Quickly she put forward her hand to protect herself.
She entered, and he followed, flashing on the light.
And she turned her face to the wall, feeling beaten.
“Can’t I do anything else for you?  “For me?
Madame gave Alvina a fine awl and some waxed thread.
But run, run!  And Madame really stamped her foot.
“I have my key and can see quite well, she said.
But obstinately he lounged into the street with her.
Within a hair’s-breadth she had let him disappear.
“Can I come to Woodhouse?  “When?  “Today.
Helplessly she put her hand across the table to him.
He spread his hands, deprecating, not understanding.
“Yes—eh? His eyes gleamed on her for a moment.
Geoffrey arrived, his broad face hot and perspiring.
Isn’t that your opinion?  The other men laughed.
What, isn’t it so?  “Of course, said Alvina.
Ciccio stood with his hands on the table, listening.
I’ve made breakfast for years, now, said Alvina.
Well—it might have been worse.  Again he waited.
They had regard for her possibilities as an heiress.
“I’m going to keep the insurance money, any way.
Never had Ciccio’s brow looked so ominously black.
And then—the unknown vengeance of the authorities.
And Alvina came in with the rest: she paid no board.
“Why are you going to the library? he asked her.
She could be quite happy by herself among the lakes.
I’d rather have him than your smarmy slormin sort.
Dr. Mitchell pointed to the green pile of cucumbers.
“May I come in? His voice sounded almost flirty.
“What do you think of this new war? said Alvina.
Who was this elderly man, that she should marry him?
Certainly her shoulder hurt where he had gripped it.
They did not meet a great deal outside the hospital.
“Do play again! Mrs. Tuke called into the night.
“Do ask him to come up for a minute, Effie said.
Mrs. Tuke had a baby daughter, and was getting well.
She wondered if he had a right to be angry with her.
You don’t want to marry a man you can’t talk to.
“I haven’t brought him, he said, watching her.
Ciccio really was much handsomer since his marriage.
She quivered, as if it was more than she could bear.
The sea heaved with a sucking noise inside the dock.
Then came the first cry one ever hears: “_Porteur!
They expected Pancrazio to meet them at the station.
Words of American sounded among the Italian dialect.
Ciccio picked up the bread and put it under his arm.
“I told them to make a fire and prepare the house.
He seemed to do everything, old, stooping as he was.
They all tried it once, but they would not go again.
Approaching it were rows of low cabins—fairly new.
She went inside, and was almost sick with repulsion.
She sank lower on the flowers, and her head dropped.
She would do anything rather than be really crushed.
Poetry cannot lie because it never pretends to fact.
His reason for favoring the third view is important.
For him allegory involved distortion and perversion.
The poet presents truth under the guise of allegory.
The instrument of poetry was the rhetorical example.
If either are taken literally, they will seem false.
It truly makes a world nearer to our heart's desire.

We were alone, however, and that was rest in itself.
This tenting was all of a dark brown or black color.
Explanations were made, and the camels soon quieted.
For this, however, there is a very plausible excuse.
All these movements we photographed with our camera.
But, nothing daunted, they would pass round the hat.

There are innumerable contemporary references to him.
There is more than one reference to them in Molière.
I might do something with them.  “Thank you, sir.
“Three hundred and fifty dollars! she ejaculated.
“You look strong and healthy, observed Mrs. Rand.
It was some minutes after ten when he left the house.
Now the opportunity had come, but could he accept it?
He felt that it was important for him to do his best.
She was the nurse, who had constant charge of Ernest.
“No, I want to stay with him, indicating Chester.
You only wanted to get rid of the kid.  “Exactly.
“I always did like Western people.  “Thank you.
“Yes, sir.  “I can tell you something about it.
“I think he is pretty well off, answered Chester.
It would make it easier for him to discharge Chester.
“I guess I’ll go and see Chester Rand, he said.
So he got up a false charge against me of dishonesty.
It may have fallen into the hands of your stepfather.
“It may be because she doesn’t know your address.
I am an old friend, and have a right to remember you.
“I have found a place for you, he said, brightly.
About this period he received a letter from Wyncombe.
When do you want to start?  “As soon as possible.
You may take the wrong cars.  Again Chester smiled.
Abner Trimble turned pale and uttered an imprecation.
Houghton’s Great Bargain Events were really events.
After some years of hanging on, he let go splendidly.
As James went further into life, he became a dreamer.
She had fully decided never to leave her two charges.
“She’s a lady if ever there was one, they said.
The people did not like her, yet she influenced them.
And yet he felt Klondyke as the greatest blow of all.
But it was Throttle-Ha’penny that made him tremble.
The sardonic quality was, however, quite in abeyance.
For some days she went about happily, in pure relief.
I simply can’t bear it, and there’s an end of it.
It was so characteristic, that Alvina almost laughed.
She believed that Alvina was just speaking at random.
She put it down on the drab-painted chest of drawers.
But her backbone became only the stronger and firmer.
But she never for one moment reflected on the advice.
Manchester House had settled down on her like a doom.
And so it was during these months nursing her mother.
The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled.
Become a nameless nobody, occupying obscure premises?
Miss Pinnegar watched him with a sort of sullen fury.
“Oh well, so be it, said her spirit vindictively.
“Good morning, Miss Houghton, said Arthur Witham.
I wouldn’t sleep in _that_ for a trifle, by myself!
“It is bad, he said furious because of the shock.
She got his handkerchief and wiped her fingers on it.
“It’s got to be done, Sunday tomorrow, he said.
Look here! She showed the bloodstains on her dress.
There was something aggressive and vulgar about them.
There have been enough stories about ordinary people.
“I missed a chance there, said James, fluttering.
“One! he said officially, pushing out the ticket.
Time came, and the colliers began to drum their feet.
“I don’t believe they like the turns, she said.
She was getting so tired of Mr. May’s quiet prance.
She was supposed to be “carrying on with Mr. May.
Queer cuts these!—but just a little bit beyond her.
Usually she spoke in French only, with her young men.
She spoke an appropriate good-night, to each of them.
He still shook dissent, but opened his mouth at last.
Then he straightened himself again, and turned aside.
He perked up his head in an odd, parrot-like fashion.
It was his instinct to say at once he would take her.
“You’ve seen nothing—nothing, he said to her.
You don’t know anything by looking at these people.
That is very nice also.  “Yes, replied Mr. May.
“But why is it? said Mr. May, angry and petulant.
Max, thou dost not want to part, brother, well-loved?
And if thou can’st find him, bring him again to us.
He knew Ciccio was dissatisfied, and wanted a change.
His skin was delicately tawny, and slightly lustrous.
“But I don’t like to take _these_, said Alvina.
Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking.
Alvina felt a burning inside her, thinking of Ciccio.
He will go out to somewhere.  Alvina looked at him.
Or he will draw you down, down—Yes, one or another.
But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them.
Offers of charity were innumerable—for three weeks.
So much money is certain, perhaps there will be more.
Ciccio was on Alvina’s right hand: a delicate hint.
“Do have it since you like it.  “Oh, I can’t!
“Really, eh? he said, holding out his large hand.
Alvina strolled away towards the half-open bookstall.
“Fine piano—eh? he said, looking into her face.
“I don’t mind, really, if I can live, she said.
You haven’t a small travelling case, Miss Houghton?
Then she washed up, removing all traces of the feast.
Mrs. Rollings would not appear till later in the day.
You will be here a few days?  “No, said Alvina.
May I ask where your company is performing this week?
Mercifully, for the mere moment, she was independent.
“You’ve heard? said Miss Pinnegar dramatically.
“That’s ’appen for them as doesn’t like them.
This was another matter, apart from her Dr. Mitchell.
The matron softly closed the door again, withdrawing.
And then you need be surprised at nothing, _nothing_.
Apart from Dr. Mitchell she had a magic potentiality.
Yes do! Mrs. Tuke’s eyes were arched and excited.
Why shouldn’t one human being go away from another?
“We’ll give him a glass of Tommy’s famous port.
You should have faith in life.  “But I hate life.
It was such a long time since she had thought of him.
You come with me.  “Ha! she sniffed scornfully.
She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow.
She caught Ciccio’s arm, as the boat rolled gently.
But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky.
Adieu! cried Gigi, clutching the other man’s arm.
It had been dark a long time when they reached Turin.
Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them.
But it isn’t the place for young people to live in.
“Don’t you think it’s fun? she said, smiling.
The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment.
“I believe I’m going to have a child, she said.
It all seemed alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.
Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian.
A shiver of horror and death went through the valley.
He hath bene knowne by his coate this thirtie Winter.
For they both invent,   fame, and devise many things.
But his ideas are based upon a very different theory.

“When one business suspends it affects all the rest.
“You asked me where you could find a bed, he said.
He has no money.  “No, I ain’t, snarled Silas.
If your bequest amounts to anything I will not object.
“Did my nephew leave any money? he asked, sharply.
“Twenty minutes.  “And you received ten dollars.
Chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard.
Mullins—been in this office?  “About five years.
A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.
“You did not forget your appointment.  “No, sir.
“That is my poor, little cousin, explained Arthur.
He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.
Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.
If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?
There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.
Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.
Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.
He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.
“Assuredly, my dear sir, said Gripp, with suavity.
Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.
“Is that Mr. Fairchild’s office? inquired Silas.
“Was this package given you at the bank? he asked.
I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.
“Don’t you remember me, Mr. Wilson? said Edward.
“Will your son be able to pay this? asked Chester.
“I had a few dollars saved, and went to Minneapolis.
He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.
But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.
A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.
Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.
Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.
James hovered round and said the last word, of course.
He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.
He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.
The food was objectionable—yet Alvina got fat on it.
It is but one side of the medal—the crowned reverse.
Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.
Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.
She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.
Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.
And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.
“Nonsense, child! expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.
Will you explain why! retorted James, turtling also.
“And father has no money, I’m sure, said Alvina.
It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Witham’s part.
He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.
The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.
“Are they for me? she said, with false brightness.
I believe he’s a despicable character, said James.
Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.
“The bone isn’t broken, she said professionally.
Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.
But all the time, what was there actually in her life?
She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.
Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.
Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.
He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.
As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.
Which is all I have to say, announced Miss Pinnegar.
After all, your father’s affairs don’t concern me.
But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.
“Goodness! she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.
“I’ll go to bed, said Madame, obediently rising.
“Good-night, my faithful Max, I trust myself to you.
Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.
What does Madame _do_? she asked a little jealously.
But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.
He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.
Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.
“If the bone isn’t broken! said Louis anxiously.
Please!  “What? said Madame, eyeing her closely.
“Yes, he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.
She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.
She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.
“Oh yes! she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.
“But you can’t help it, away there from everybody.
It is all of it true, whispered Madame vindictively.
“This is polite behaviour! she said sarcastically.
But I’ve been here many years, said Miss Pinnegar.
Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.
But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.
I shall see. Till one and all became angry with her.
“At the station! exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.
It was my great-grandmother’s.  “Do you mean it?
Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.
After all, she had been bred up differently from that.
“I’ve had ham and eggs before.  “You do, hein?
She clung to Ciccio’s dark, despised foreign nature.
“We must have supper.  It was past nine o’clock.
Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.
Upon my word!  “I don’t think so, said Alvina.
“Good-morning! she said, and went on with her tea.
“But you can have love without marriage, she said.
She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.
There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.
She knew she would be much cheaper in Madame’s eyes.
“You tell Atterwell what to put on father’s stone.
It must have been a detective—some shoddy detective.
She insisted on Miss Pinnegar’s having half of this.
Gradually Dr. Mitchell’s manner changed towards her.
“I didn’t intend to disturb you, nurse, he said.
But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.
“I think to Windermere—into the Lakes, she said.
The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.
“I quite understand that, he replied deliberately.
Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!
“Don’t play a game with me, he said dangerously.
But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.
“Shall you come with me to Italy, Allaye?  “Yes.
So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.
A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.
There were quarries near the railway, and men working.
The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.
“Come in, and warm yourself, said the young woman.
And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.
It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.
She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.
But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.
She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.
“Would you?  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.
“How nice they are! said Alvina when she had left.
She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.

“To-morrow is New Year’s Day.  “What if ’tis?
But ain’t you working up at the store?  “Not now.
Mr. Tripp cut down my wages, and I left.  “Do tell.
“Good-evening, Mr. Tripp, said Mrs. Rand, politely.
“From Chicago, ma’am.  “Were you at work there?
“Glad to see you, widder, said Silas Tripp, grimly.
Everything was new to him, and, of course, interesting.
“Do you always eat here, Mr. Conrad? asked Chester.
“No; sometimes it is more convenient to go elsewhere.
Good morning, ma’am.  And Felix hurried downstairs.
Mr. Fairchild may suspect something if I move too soon.
“I am afraid Ernest annoys you, said the professor.
Must you have me risk prison?  “Don’t be alarmed!
I only want you to borrow two or three hundred dollars.
Finally his forefinger stopped at an entry on the book.
“I am ever so much obliged, said Felix, effusively.
“Will my being a boy make any difference? he asked.
I am Guy Radcliff.  “Glad to see you, Mr. Radcliff.
The last time I was in the city it cost me forty cents.
“I am sorry to say it.  “But what was the matter?

She carried it over her arm down to the Miners’ Arms.
Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her.
In Vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering.
Over Alexander’s letter Miss Frost shed bitter tears.
It seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take.
There was a great bustle, preparing her nursing outfit.
For in her latter half she had to visit the slum cases.
It cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough.
And there was an abundance of Throttle-Ha’penny coal.
Wherein lies every moral that mankind can wish to draw.
Iridescent golden—could anything be more fascinating!
With Miss Frost its spirit passed away: it was no more.
“Good morning, Mr. Witham, replied Alvina brightly.
She felt as if she were really venturing on new ground.
Arthur lingered in the doorway a while, then went away.
Look here— And he began to pull up his trouser leg.
But Alvina had given the candle to Calladine, and fled.
For months, the thought of Albert was a torment to her.
“We never can understand those things, said Alvina.
I can see nothing wrong with him, said Miss Pinnegar.
Yet it was always packed with colliers and work-lasses.
He had decided he must make a percentage in other ways.
Alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically.
It nearly killed James to take the prices they offered.
Madame and the four young men had arrived at about six.
It’s his business to go.  “Oh! returned Alvina.
“I’m afraid your cold is rather bad, said Alvina.
“Manca il cuore solamente al Ciccio, moaned Madame.
Afterwards he was to carry up the horse-hair arm-chair.
My poor _braves_, what will they do without Kishwégin?
The two tall Swiss looked down on him, faintly smiling.
He glanced round at Alvina, then went on with his work.
“We like her—we love her—as if she were a mother.
From the head I am business-woman, good business-woman.
“Alors! said Madame, cutting through this futility.
“Dost thou want to go with him? she asked suddenly.
Tell him that.  Geoffrey turned again into the house.
He looked at her sideways, furtively, but persistently.
And then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner!
But I won’t stay a minute.  “Oh, it is all right.
“You get dressed, Ciccio.  Ciccio looked at Alvina.
The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.
She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.
He will not trouble you.  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.
But if you have decided—  Neither of them answered.
“Miss Houghton herself must decide.  “Oh sure—!
It won’t be much, then?  “Really, I don’t know.
Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit.
“So, we go together in the cab, said Madame to him.
And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.
But she knew it was something improper, on her account.
Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.
And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.
Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.
Why— he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate.
“How do you do? and she thrust out her hand to him.
I mean them.  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.
You need to be looked after.  “Do I, Miss Pinnegar!
Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.
Comment allez-vous, alors?  “Bien! said Geoffrey.
“But I might be afraid of a husband-bear, she said.
“Yes, they both slept in the end room, said Alvina.
I don’t think so.  “But even then, said Alvina.
When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.
Madame did not consider Alvina’s view very seriously.
And cucumbers are poison to everybody.  “_Cum-bers!
“Men are always intruders, he smiled to the matron.
He could put a nasty intonation into that monosyllable.
“You will take my ring.  “Yes, she said coldly.
There was a slight flavour of art and literature about.
There was a certain freemasonry in the matron’s room.
The Tukes were not very rich—the young ones, that is.
I don’t carry bags because my heart is rather groggy.
She would commit herself to him through every eternity.
They ran through Bromley and out into the open country.
For there behind, behind all the sunshine, was England.
She sat very still for a long time, almost an eternity.
The ship slowly put about, and backed into the harbour.
Some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness.
He had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest.
“We will sit here, as I do, to eat, said Pancrazio.
Pancrazio was very happy if Alvina would accompany him.
Alvina meanwhile would sew for the child, or spin wool.

A DYING GIFT       V. CHESTER’S FIRST SUCCESS      VI.
During the night four or five inches of snow had fallen.
In a short time they had reached the minister’s house.
But, Mr. Tripp, I’ve come here on business.  “Hey?
It was paid for out of the minister’s charitable fund.
“How long were you in making the drawing? she asked.
He’s talkin’ of reducin’ me to two dollars a week.
“I supposed you’d stand up for him, sneered Silas.
“Where is my money, you villain? he demanded, hotly.
There was one thing, however, that Chester did not know.
He discharged Abel Wood soon after you went to New York.
“He’s a scamp! commented the man from Minneapolis.
“Are you going to the theater, Chester? asked Felix.
He was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us.
I was in luck.  “Do you get six dollars?  “More.
“Isn’t he here now? demanded Silas, with surprise.
“It is a wonderful place, Chester, said Mr. Perkins.
A pickpocket took it while I was looking in at a window.
When Mr. Fairchild returned Felix delivered the message.
“Shan’t I see you again, Mr. Wilson? asked Edward.
It is two dollars more than I received at my last place.
She has     held out pretty firm, but she may yield yet.
I did not think to look.  “Your case is unfortunate.
Mullins, I haven’t the least intention of harming you.
“The next day my employer summoned me to his presence.
Perhaps all they lack is an occupation: in short, a job.
But the poor-spirited Woodhouse people were weak buyers.
The whole affair was ricketty, amateurish, and twopenny.
So she neither questioned nor accepted, but just let be.
At such times Miss Frost’s heart went cold within her.
Act just for yourself, dear—the rest doesn’t matter.
If it had she would certainly never have entertained it.
But she had serious confidential talks with Dr. Fordham.
This was the end of another woman’s life: such an end!
Her mother’s little sitting-room was cold and disused.
It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master.
“But we don’t want father to go on with this scheme.
He seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element.
“No, I don’t know so much about that, said Albert.
But it has its attractions. Here he smiled meaningful.
Without a thought, she turned on her heel and fled away.
“Are you hurt? called Alvina, looking up into space.
“Which way? she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.
In the Withams’ pew sat Lottie and Albert—no Arthur.
“You never spoke to Mr. Witham? Miss Pinnegar asked.
Now he found himself more or less stranded in Woodhouse.
And swamped—_swamped_ with her dirty old carrot water.
She scorned to count “Welcome All. Mr. May said Yes.
But she marched down one of the pews, and took her seat.
But Miss Pinnegar was sadly hot and squeezed in her pew.
Sudden curtain, and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers.
Miss Poppy herself sets all store on her cup and saucer.
“How much have we taken, father? asked Alvina gaily.
“But perhaps tomorrow.  “No, today, said Madame.
The bear drops Ciccio lifeless, and turns to Kishwégin.
“I should love to go.  He looked down into her eyes.
Why are you at all?  “Nonsensical? laughed Alvina.
“And what about yellow eyes? asked Alvina, laughing.
“May I hear it too?  “Oh, said Madame, drawling.
“Comment? queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.
And how?—and where?—in this country?—tell me that.
Is he quite obstinate?  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.
Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.
“Do come! she urged, never taking her eyes from him.
“Won’t you come? She smiled strangely and vividly.
Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.
True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.
“I should like awfully— a flush grew on her cheek.
Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.
The doctor came—she went to the registrar—and so on.
But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.
“On ne fume pas dans le salon, said Madame brutally.
Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.
“What about the theatre?—will it go on? she asked.
I don’t know, she doesn’t seem to hook on, does she?
She’d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.
“I couldn’t keep away from you, Madame, she cried.
You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.
“Yet he promised.  Again Madame smiled sardonically.
“See, my dear, that your money is safe, said Madame.
“What a good brooch, eh? Madame fingered the brooch.
There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.
“Pacohuila! cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.
A’ open ’eart ’s worth all your bum-righteousness.
“You can have that if you like, Madame, said Alvina.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.
But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.
“The best! He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.
And your father a month dead.  “It doesn’t matter.
He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.
Don’t you all?  The two other men smiled and nodded.
Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.
It’s almost _White Slave Traffic_, on Madame’s part.
She didn’t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.
I wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation.
But their hearts hardened with black, indomitable anger.
But Alvina felt herself particularly excluded, left out.
Then she wired home to her doctor for another reference.
She went rapidly from case to case, as she was summoned.
“Why I do ten times the work that any one of you does.
came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina.
But I think I’m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.
They went downstairs, and Alvina returned to her duties.
“The pains have begun, said Alvina, hurrying to her.
But the doctor had replied that Nurse would ring him up.
She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster.
“Of course!—another of Mrs. Tuke’s exclamations.
England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging.
Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions.
“I think it’s lovely—wonderful, she said, dazed.
Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water.
His yellow, luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her.
Beautiful, in our musical sense of the word, it was not.
Fortunately he was turning round talking to another man.

For the present, therefore, I feel obliged to retain him.
It will depend on the success I meet with in my business.
Now we can talk freely.  “That’s what I came about.
Why, I started off on a sudden without consulting anyone.
You will get no help from him.  “I begin to think so.
I’ll return it soon, said Radcliff, looking relieved.
“That can’t be possible!  “It is a fact, however.
You were out in a boat yourself, and saw the whole thing.
“Yes, answered the poor mother, in a spiritless tone.
But one chronic and dreary malady: that of the odd women.
He expected to get at least ten thousand pounds with her.
He flitted, with a tense look on his face, to Manchester.
True, he became also Superintendent of the Sunday School.
One would have expected his æsthetic eye to be offended.
And this it was, perhaps, that scared away the young men.
“I don’t really know, she said, laughing hurriedly.
She knew the same would ring in her mother’s dying cry.
They all seemed like blank sheets of paper in comparison.
She enjoyed the smell of a toasted bloater, rather burnt.
She was returning to Woodhouse virgin as she had left it.
With Miss Frost all was openness, explicit and downright.
But Alvina liked to be with Miss Pinnegar in the kitchen.
In the afternoon, directly after dinner, Alvina went out.
And of course, Alvina was considered a lady in Woodhouse.
“Is this one of your old walks? she asked, malicious.
Putting her umbrella between him and her, she walked off.
“Let us go down, said Mr. May, “and look at a site.
You must be prepared to spend something at the beginning.
“In the theatrical line, I’m sure, declared Alvina.
Alvina hastily retreated, but Miss Pinnegar stood it out.
Chot-let, penny a bar! away she banged at another tune.
He came fairly frequently to Manchester House after this.
He cocked his blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened.
She was _déclassée_: she had lost her class altogether.
And they had always a certain fund of callous philosophy.
The young men looked at her, and muttered to one another.
“Che natura povera, senza sentimento—niente di bello.
He was quite drunk with his first sleep, and saw nothing.
Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.
You’ve never been out of England?  “No, she said.
And then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business.
I am an old woman—  “Younger than I, said Alvina.
And now let me give you one little token of my gratitude.
Alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage.
“Are they both staying, or only one? she said tartly.
“What _is_ his name, Madame?  “Marasca—Francesco.
Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her.
Pity some nice young man doesn’t turn up and marry her.
“Certainly, said Louis, bowing also over his tea-cup.
“Now then, said Madame briskly, “we are all agreed.
And the young men stirred uneasily, and smiled furtively.
“Hurons—Hirondelles, means _swallows_, said Madame.
Madame locked up the jewels quickly, after one last look.
That’s why I’m glad to leave it. There was a pause.
La pauvre fille—pauvre demoiselle! lamented Geoffrey.
Miss Pinnegar wilted and felt strange under so many eyes.
Mr. May laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over.
Oh!  “Not if you think those things— said Alvina.
It was already ten o’clock when she hurried downstairs.
Then he’d believe in you.  But Ciccio shook his head.
“Does it mean we owe seven hundred pounds? she asked.
I can’t believe it.  “So he told me, said Alvina.
“What are we to do? said Max, pale on the cheekbones.
Curse them! Louis was muttering, in his rolling accent.
They kept within the four-square enclosure of themselves.
“Pff—! he went, with a whistling sound of contempt.
“What’s that, mister? replied the mystified hawker.
“There! she said, bobbing a little curtsey to Alvina.
Lancaster was busy with a sort of fête, notwithstanding.
“I felt I ought to do something.  “Why? he asked.
Upon it was the mourning-ring Miss Frost had always worn.
“I may congratulate _you_, you mean, said the matron.
And it cast a slight slur of vulgar familiarity over her.
This she gathered from her contact with the local gentry.
And to make me howl because I’ve got a child inside me.
The faint, stupid half-smile, half-sneer was on his lips.
Alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert Ciccio.
How sick she was of other people and their importunities!
Ciccio’s a treat to be with, because he’s so natural.
And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell.
It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her.
CHAPTER XIV THE JOURNEY ACROSS   The train began to move.
It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light.
And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.
But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad.
Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant.
And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced.
It was rather like the crying of half-articulate animals.
Alvina sat with Ciccio stripping them, in the corn-place.
This was where Ciccio belonged: his active, mindful self.
She came upon a bankside all wide with lavender crocuses.
The high-road was depressing, wherever there were houses.

Come and Buy Without Price.  James was in his eye-holes.
But he exacted that they should buy one article at a time.
And yet she remained good friends with the odd little man.
Mr. Houghton was very much concerned over Madame’s cold.
There was a slight look of self-commiseration on her face.
And so, what will they do without their old _gouvernante_?
The foreigners shrugged their shoulders, and paid no heed.
Can I make Miss Houghton’s father lose these two nights?
It was all very well for Alvina to bang the piano crossly.
“Leave me alone. But he looked anything but all right.
“You do not know him yet, she said, turning to Alvina.
The meal, with the three women at table, passed painfully.
We must catch the train.  “Oh but—won’t you drive?
“And if there is something?  “I don’t know either.

Each _brave_ also kissed her hand, with a profound salute.
And she looked back at him, heavy-eyed and half subjected.
“The gift of Pacohuila you know, said Madame, smiling.
On’y we’ve got to keep up appearances a bit, you know.
How _can_ you—  Alvina was hustled off to her lodging.
With what close curiosity Madame examined the ruby brooch.
“I am tired, I shall go early to my room, said Alvina.
They were a good-humoured company in the railway carriage.
Your poor father!  “I’m sure the dead are all right.
“This was my mother’s little sitting-room, she said.
And closing her book, she rose and went to the other room.
This house, and all it contains?  “Yes, said Alvina.
“Voyez, un cochon de lait, said Gigi amply and calmly.
When Ciccio returned, Alvina was once more washing dishes.
She sang to herself as she went about her work downstairs.
Nothing is ours—not even the plate you’re eating from.

He was heard talking to some one in the moonlight outside.
The moment Mrs. Tuke recovered her breath she began again.
But the slow, remote look in her eyes made this fall flat.
Her thoughts flew to Woodhouse, the grey centre of it all.
Alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like.
She was rather smoke-dried too, from perpetual wood-smoke.
There had been a little garden within the stone enclosure.

It was eight o’clock before she asked her first question.
Alvina started and looked round at her with wide blue eyes.
“Let us go, said Mr. May, bubbling with new importance.
Max slipped on a tattered hunting-shirt and cartridge belt.
You see, that’s it.  “But how has Madame made it all?
“And I am very glad you have been such a good Kishwégin.
Let us see.  So gradually Max was brought to stand still.
He will perhaps wait for me at his cousin’s in Battersea.

Alvina stooped and crouched under the right arm of Pacohuila.
I don’t like ’em comin’ in an’ goin’ out, you know.
“I’d better fetch some things, hadn’t I? said Alvina.
His remoteness, his southernness, something velvety and dark.
He laughed too, and picked up her bag as if it were a bubble.
Geoffrey was standing monumental between her and the company.
Fortunately for them, Madame had seen to their table-manners.
She knew she would have to break her own trance of obstinacy.
Perhaps even something might be done about the cinematograph.
He took to the attentive study of his finger-nails once more.
“What barrow-load of poison is that! repeated the doctor.
I may be moved any day now.  “Well—! said the matron.
“Oh, but so many things happen outside one’s imagination.
It might just as well—  Alvina would laugh and get tired.
Gleams, flashes, noises and then at last the frenzy of Paris.
His face was pale, he had that sombre, haunted, unhappy look.
She was thinking how she would be “more comfortable here.
Then he disappeared, returning in a few moments with the ass.
There were two high white beds on opposite sides of the room.
She felt vaguely that Ciccio was miserable, and wondered why.
And then, screaming high in dialect, Maria would talk to her.
She saw the snow-ridges flare with evening, beyond his cheek.
She sat and cried over the first she found: heaven knows why.
Death and eternity were settled down on her as she sat alone.

The execution is a minor matter.  Chester looked thoughtful.
He told me he washed his hands of me.  Chester looked sober.
“Yes, Mr. Tripp.  “I can’t understand it, for my part.
The distance by rail from Wyncombe to New York is fifty miles.
And how do you like my quarters?  “They are very pleasant.
“I will go in and introduce you.  They entered the office.
“No.  “When will he be in?  “Can’t say, I am sure.
Obviously the receipt belonged to James Long, who had lost it.
“I guess you are used to babies, said the mother, pleased.
“I would, but I am to meet a friend uptown at six o’clock.
Though well convinced of it, he wished to find out positively.
He has tried two boys since, but doesn’t seem to get suited.
But how did he happen to call on you?  “There you have me.
He felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once.
He wished this to be an agreeable surprise at some future day.
About six o’clock one afternoon Chester knocked at his door.
My mother is naturally cautious, and would not give it to him.
“How much is the fare to Tacoma from this point? he asked.
It was clear that adversity had strengthened and improved him.
And yet, his curious refinement and enthusiasm bore them away.
But still he believed in his own excellence: and quite justly.
She brought in flowers and books, and, very rarely, a visitor.
Luckily, he sold one machine and even gained two pounds on it.
“What! said a collier to his wife: “have we got no coal?
“Oh well, if she _does_— said Miss Pinnegar cryptically.
And in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy, shabby.
“I can’t see what it is to laugh at, said Miss Pinnegar.
That’s where he gets his ideas—out of whiskey—or brandy!
_Still_, she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority.
These were his children—most curious chips of the old block.
She liked taking a walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion.
He mounted the steps, still holding his bunch of white stocks.
“Well, said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered.
He annoyed her a little, by being completely oblivious of her.
And she, obedient, began to tie the bandage with numb fingers.
She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him.
“And is there need to understand the other?  “Certainly.
“Don’t you want your dinner, Alvina? she said at length.
They wanted to examine my private morals, for eugenic reasons.
“I hope you’ll go further than _thinking_, said Mr. May.
I can dance today.  “I don’t think today, said Alvina.
“You won’t have to dance, said Geoffrey out of the bear.
I am practical impractically— she stumbled over the words.
Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.
But perhaps to you it is kind.  “Thank you, said Alvina.
There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.
“Geoffrey ought to know, said Madame, looking at Geoffrey.
His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.
She heard Miss Pinnegar’s scarcely audible step approaching.
I wouldn’t think of it. He turtled like an injured pigeon.
“What makes you feel so sure about it?  “I don’t know.
He looked up, with a faint smile, from under his black lashes.
And will you hang your coat in the hall? she said to Ciccio.
“At any rate I know now, she said, in rather a flat voice.
“And if there is nothing, what do you intend? said Madame.
Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.
“Old paste—old paste—antique—  “No, said Alvina.
Then she looked into Alvina’s eyes, really a little jealous.
“L’allée italienne! he said, and shouted with laughter.
Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.
Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.
Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.
So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.
Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.  “Don’t say so!
Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.
“And where are the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras this week? he asked.
She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.
“I am staying with friends, here and there, for a few weeks.
“I’m afraid there is nothing very pleasant, unfortunately.
In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.
I must go this afternoon.  “On account of your engagement?
“You couldn’t have anything more wholesome and nourishing.
More cumbers I sell, more graft for you, ’cordin’ to that.
He could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion.
He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.
“Oh, it will be over in six weeks, said the doctor easily.
Don’t think about it.  He caught her hand and clung to it.
“I shall _never_ marry him.  “Ah, never is a long while!
‘_O Richard, O mon roi!_’—  But the music had stopped.
Nothing will sing if you’re there, called the young woman.
Do let me see him.  “Do you really want to? said Alvina.
Ciccio shifted on his feet, watching Alvina pour out the port.
He pointed to the harbour clock—it was ten minutes past ten.
So she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin.
“I couldn’t get a cart to come down, he said in English.
“They are doing some washing, said Pancrazio, explanatory.
Pancrazio seized the leading rope angrily and turned upstream.
And then again they struck off to the right, under some trees.
They loved her that she would strip maize-cobs or pick acorns.
“If you are very long, she said, “I shall go to England.
In the twilight he came to her, when she could hardly see him.

As they passed Lord & Taylor’s, a lady came out of the store.

“You are misinformed about my wanting to locate in this city.
Usually the bookkeeper did not show up till half an hour later.
“Go after him! he said, in a low voice, indicating Ralston.

“Are you sick?  “Yes, sick at heart, was the sad reply.
He attributed this to my influence over her, but it was not so.

“I hope I see you well, ma’am, he said, bobbing his head.

I have been assisted by a fortunate investment in outside lots.
What he failed to perceive was that the crowd hated excellence.
The whole morale of the house rested immediately on Miss Frost.
But still, the two unprotected ones must be sheltered from him.
He had desisted from “creations. Time now for a new flight.
The square green emerald on her finger was almost non-sensical.
It was as if she found her busy contact with life a strain now.
Inwardly, Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from questioning.
There was an inflexible fate within her, which shaped her ends.
And Alvina cried also: she did not quite know why or wherefore.
And then he came out with the most original of all his schemes.
He’s out of his mind—and it’s drink; that’s what it is!
As soon as James came in to a meal, the two women attacked him.
She would pitch her dead negative will obstinately against him.
He knew he would have to sacrifice Miss Pinnegar’s work-room.
Lottie Witham came to tea, and was shown over Manchester House.
She began to laugh nervously and hurriedly at the very thought.
“No, it’s not that! hurriedly expostulated Miss Pinnegar.
“Father is in.  “Yes, I don’t mind, he said, pleased.
“Do you think so? he replied, again with the excited smile.
So she brought him a light, whilst he examined his broken shin.
“That gives you what for, he said, as if it were her fault.
Now Mr. May’s mind, though quick, was pedestrian, not winged.
“With a month’s notice on either hand? continued Mr. May.
And the things she said reminded Alvina so often of Miss Frost.
don’t you think so? And he rolled his eyes oddly to heaven.
But it merely meant that James was having the time of his life.
It was not till later in the evening that he relaxed this rule.
The film is only pictures, like pictures in the _Daily Mirror_.
The chemist was gone to Chapel—he wouldn’t open till eight.
Alvina brushed out the long black hair, and plaited it lightly.
Mrs. Rollings is warming a blanket—  Alvina ran downstairs.
He did not say a word, but held aloof as he walked with Alvina.
“You are an Englishwoman, severe and materialist, she said.
“Come! said Madame, stretching out her plump jewelled hand.
“You are better, dear Madame? he said, smiling long at her.
The morning was faintly sunny, after the sleet and bad weather.
Ciccio springs forward and stabs the bear, then closes with it.
It was wonderful how well the men played their different parts.

On the contrary, I think it is unkind for you also, this place.
“You see I didn’t care for the Woodhouse young men, either.
“Excuse my intruding on your mirth! He looked archly round.
His hand started, dropped the cigarette, but was not withdrawn.
“I say, Cic’— he said, “why did you change the scene?
Try.  “I know they are, said Alvina, laughing confusedly.
“I’m all right, I tell you, said James, his eyes flaring.
“Yes, she whispered involuntarily, soulless, like a victim.
“Oh my dear, we shall be too much—  “No, said Alvina.
Francesco Marasca—Neapolitan.  “Marasca! echoed Alvina.
There were substantial bills owing on account of the Endeavour.
That is too rich.  Max went off into a high and ribald laugh.
“I’m afraid I shall never be particular enough, she said.
“Please don’t come, she said, turning at the street door.
She preferred his tawny eyes with their black brows and lashes.
And a good-humoured, half-mocking smile came over his face too.
And all the time he watched her curiously, from his large eyes.
“I didn’t know there’d be two of you, was her greeting.
“Ciccio came to carry my bag.  “Oh, said Miss Pinnegar.
“You are going to take a hand?  “Cards on Sunday evening!
And you two are cycling back to the camp of Kishwégin tonight?
She doesn’t want a tame bear. He smiled down on his friend.
“I will give you another pillow.  She led the way upstairs.
“Perhaps you would rather decide later.  “No, she said.
She knew her own position with the troupe would be humiliating.
Then she sent Max over to Mansfield, on some fictitious errand.
No doubt about it, the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were under suspicion.
She had no serious acquaintance with anybody, she was too busy.
“You look tired this morning, he barked at her one hot day.
“My business is what’s wrong with the stomach it goes into.
He went into the matron’s room, and asked for Nurse Houghton.
“But put that aside, he smiled again, a little dangerously.

The matron had known Walter Pater, in the somewhat remote past.
His throbbing, muscular power seemed completely to envelop her.
“I understood one line, said Effie, making big eyes at him.
You’re just at the mercy of _Forces_, she shrieked angrily.

Ciccio looked up and down for Pancrazio, but could not see him.
They came down to the level valley bed, and went rolling along.
There was a battered photograph of Lord Leighton, among others.
