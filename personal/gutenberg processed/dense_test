Why, you know Mr. _Shatter_ has pawn’d the Horses.
And you, _Frank_, will you marry my Niece _Diana_?
I know y’are quick of Apprehension, Sir _Timothy_.
Who art thou, that thus fondly guard’st his Heart?

Sir, my Lord Plotwell is at the Door in his Coach.
And there’s need enough, and the truth were known.
To wait my Doom; what Tidings hast thou, _Guzman_?
What means he, sure he has a Gad-bee in his Brain.
Hey, Rogues, Rascals, Boys, follow me just behind.
Ah, nothing but a great gilt Coach will become it.
How now, Fellow, where’s this old Don _Francisco_?
Oh, nothing is so ventrous as Love, if it be true.

She is also courted by the cowardly fop, Falatius.
The world was full on’t, and could he be ignorant?

Nay, why shouldst thou delay me thus with stories?
How cam’st thou, Friend, to hide all this from me?
_Re-enter_ Falatius, _with_ Alcander _melancholy_.
My Lord the Prince, what makes your Highness here?
--Where dost thou mean, bad Man, to hide thy head?

He’s talkin’ of reducin’ me to two dollars a week.
“You look strong and healthy,” observed Mrs. Rand.
You found the whisky here.”  Ramsay made no reply.
He says that he left it behind in the office here.
“No, I want to stay with him,” indicating Chester.
But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.
You only wanted to get rid of the kid.”  “Exactly.
Must you have me risk prison?”  “Don’t be alarmed!
“I think he is pretty well off,” answered Chester.
I was in luck.”  “Do you get six dollars?”  “More.
“I am sorry to say it.”  “But what was the matter?
“That can’t be possible!”  “It is a fact, however.

Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.
Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.
The new entertainment was the Friday-night’s sale.
In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.
She was not particularly religious by inclination.
It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.
She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.
But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.
Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.
Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.
Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.
Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?
So both alike were defeated in their expectations.
For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.
Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.
There was no spontaneous interchange between them.
We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.
“Oh well, so be it,” said her spirit vindictively.
“Good morning, Miss Houghton,” said Arthur Witham.
But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.
But it was Arthur who came out into communication.
He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.
“It is bad,” he said furious because of the shock.
Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.
And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.
“I missed a chance there,” said James, fluttering.
After all, your father’s affairs don’t concern me.
“One!” he said officially, pushing out the ticket.
The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.
The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.
But it’s so different with the mental friendships.
For she did not find him at all physically moving.
And _then_—she nearly set the stools on top of me.
I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.
I know we are.”  Mr. May looked down in the mouth.
And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.
She was supposed to be “carrying on” with Mr. May.
“I’m afraid your cold is rather bad,” said Alvina.
Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.
Que ferez-vous, mes pauvres, sans votre Kishwégin.
“But perhaps tomorrow.”  “No, today,” said Madame.
There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.
The prisoner is tripped up—falls, and cannot rise.
The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.
“May I hear it too?”  “Oh,” said Madame, drawling.
“I begin to wonder if I have mistaken my vocation.
“But why is it?” said Mr. May, angry and petulant.
They want it all through the eye, and finished—so!
Then what future have you?” said Mr. May gloomily.
And how?—and where?—in this country?—tell me that.
Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.
But I won’t stay a minute.”  “Oh, it is all right.
Please!”  “What?” said Madame, eyeing her closely.
She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.
He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.
She looked back at him, as from across a distance.
But all the time she was uttering her condolences.
Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.
“But you can’t help it, away there from everybody.
He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.
“What _is_ his name, Madame?”  “Marasca—Francesco.
Why sure!”  “It’s dreadful, though—!” said Alvina.
“Old paste—old paste—antique—”  “No,” said Alvina.
Yes?” she added, with her subtle, malicious smile.
It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.
A’ open ’eart ’s worth all your bum-righteousness.
Within a hair’s-breadth she had let him disappear.
“Really, eh?” he said, holding out his large hand.
There were other people in the carriage with them.
She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.
Pas pour moi!”  And they went laughing downstairs.
Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.
For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.
She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.
Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.
“You tell Atterwell what to put on father’s stone.
Never had Ciccio’s brow looked so ominously black.
And then—the unknown vengeance of the authorities.
So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.
Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.
I’d rather have him than your smarmy slormin sort.
Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.
But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.
And both of us, since we are now one,” he replied.
They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.
Yes do!” Mrs. Tuke’s eyes were arched and excited.
You should have faith in life.”  “But I hate life.
Come with me, Allaye.”  She could not look at him.
But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.
He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.
Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.
Then came the first cry one ever hears: “_Porteur!
Adieu!” cried Gigi, clutching the other man’s arm.
“I told them to make a fire and prepare the house.
And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.
This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.
Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.
Approaching it were rows of low cabins—fairly new.
She blew out the light, that she need not see him.

On the whole, things did not look very encouraging.
“You asked me where you could find a bed,” he said.
But, Mr. Tripp, I’ve come here on business.”  “Hey?

“I supposed you’d stand up for him,” sneered Silas.

Houghton’s Great Bargain Events were really events.
But it was Throttle-Ha’penny that made him tremble.
Her father tended to a supercilious, sneering tone.
It was curiosity, deep, radical, burning curiosity.
But the new and recalcitrant Vina still shone hard.
What ought James Houghton to have done differently?
“Nonsense, child!” expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.
I wouldn’t sleep in _that_ for a trifle, by myself!
He would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever.
“Are they for me?” she said, with false brightness.
I believe he’s a despicable character,” said James.
“No, I don’t know so much about that,” said Albert.
Wherever he was, his wife was a hundred miles away.
When would he be able to get an advance from James?
He wrote various letters and drew up certain notes.
I like a little yellow turnip,” said Miss Pinnegar.
“Goodness!” she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.
He was terribly secretive with respect to business.
She was getting so tired of Mr. May’s quiet prance.
Queer cuts these!—but just a little bit beyond her.
The trams, moreover, would begin to run in January.
Alvina hurried indoors, and the young man followed.
What a white-skinned, soft, plump child she seemed!
Alvina practised the music Madame carried with her.
You’ve never been out of England?”  “No,” she said.
Yet she felt convinced of his ultimate good-nature.
You don’t know anything by looking at these people.
I am an old woman—”  “Younger than I,” said Alvina.
Helpless, inert she lay, in her orgasm of laughter.
The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras all sat with straight faces.
Ah, this Woodhouse, a curse is on it, I know it is.
And if thou can’st find him, bring him again to us.
Then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction.
You must never let them think you have caught them.
Still she smiled at him, and still he gave no sign.
“Won’t you come?” She smiled strangely and vividly.
But she could not make out what his watching meant.
He was a little bit repellent and brutal, inverted.
“I should like awfully—” a flush grew on her cheek.
She loved them so much, she wanted to be with them.
He could not interrupt Alvina, nor the performance.
Mr. May came in, and stayed for a dismal half-hour.
“Yes,” he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.
Worn out!” Madame said, nodding slowly up and down.
“Oh yes!” she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.
Or he will draw you down, down—Yes, one or another.
And if he will still have you, then you must think.
“This is polite behaviour!” she said sarcastically.
But I’ve been here many years,” said Miss Pinnegar.
“What about the theatre?—will it go on?” she asked.
He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood.
We must catch the train.”  “Oh but—won’t you drive?
Alvina broke away from her cousin, and went to him.
Offers of charity were innumerable—for three weeks.
Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.
“I couldn’t keep away from you, Madame,” she cried.
“And if there is something?”  “I don’t know either.
“At the station!” exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.
The young men had been out shopping for the supper.
Ciccio was on Alvina’s right hand: a delicate hint.
I don’t like ’em comin’ in an’ goin’ out, you know.
But run, run!”  And Madame really stamped her foot.
And your father a month dead.”  “It doesn’t matter.
Comment allez-vous, alors?”  “Bien!” said Geoffrey.
You haven’t a small travelling case, Miss Houghton?
Oh!”  “Not if you think those things—” said Alvina.
Alvina looked at Ciccio, who stood above, watching.
And quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire.
“Good-morning!” she said, and went on with her tea.
“But you can have love without marriage,” she said.
I can’t believe it.”  “So he told me,” said Alvina.
The cordiality, the _joie de vivre_ did not revive.
Every one is most kind, and I feel at home already.
“Mine _isna_, tha sees,” he said, “so pap’s no use.
And I know that those things cause me half my work.
“I quite understand that,” he replied deliberately.
But wondering about the Natchas would not help her.
She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.
“I felt I ought to do something.”  “Why?” he asked.
His face was blind with anger, like a hot, red sun.
Why shouldn’t one human being go away from another?
But she found Ciccio leaning against a gate-pillar.
She caught Ciccio’s arm, as the boat rolled gently.
“Come in, and warm yourself,” said the young woman.
But it isn’t the place for young people to live in.
She was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself.
But her chest was raw, she felt weak and miserable.
“Would you?”  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.
Ciccio too was feasted, in the dark hole of a room.
“How nice they are!” said Alvina when she had left.
The old crone said something unintelligible to her.
At times other, honey scents wafted from the hills.
“I’ll come back, and we’ll go to America,” he said.

“How long were you in making the drawing?” she asked.
It was some minutes after ten when he left the house.
“Where is my money, you villain?” he demanded, hotly.
Now the opportunity had come, but could he accept it?
“No; sometimes it is more convenient to go elsewhere.
He felt that it was important for him to do his best.
She was the nurse, who had constant charge of Ernest.
“Are you going to the theater, Chester?” asked Felix.
It would make it easier for him to discharge Chester.
“It is a wonderful place, Chester,” said Mr. Perkins.
“I’d like to know what all this means,” said Ralston.
So he got up a false charge against me of dishonesty.
It may have fallen into the hands of your stepfather.
I am an old friend, and have a right to remember you.
I have some property at Tacoma.”  “You don’t mean it!
About this period he received a letter from Wyncombe.
I did not think to look.”  “Your case is unfortunate.
Abner Trimble turned pale and uttered an imprecation.
After some years of hanging on, he let go splendidly.
As James went further into life, he became a dreamer.
She carried it over her arm down to the Miners’ Arms.
She had fully decided never to leave her two charges.
The people did not like her, yet she influenced them.
And yet he felt Klondyke as the greatest blow of all.
The sardonic quality was, however, quite in abeyance.
Over Alexander’s letter Miss Frost shed bitter tears.
For some days she went about happily, in pure relief.
It was so characteristic, that Alvina almost laughed.
She believed that Alvina was just speaking at random.
She put it down on the drab-painted chest of drawers.
But her backbone became only the stronger and firmer.
But she never for one moment reflected on the advice.
Manchester House had settled down on her like a doom.
And so it was during these months nursing her mother.
And there was an abundance of Throttle-Ha’penny coal.
The thick-wicked tallow candles guttered and smelled.
Iridescent golden—could anything be more fascinating!
Become a nameless nobody, occupying obscure premises?
Will you explain why!” retorted James, turtling also.
“Well, we’ll see,” said James, rising to superiority.
Miss Pinnegar watched him with a sort of sullen fury.
“That’s what it is,” said Miss Pinnegar vindictively.
“I can’t imagine,” replied Miss Pinnegar, eyeing her.
“Are you hurt?” called Alvina, looking up into space.
She got his handkerchief and wiped her fingers on it.
“Which way?” she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.
There was something aggressive and vulgar about them.
“You never spoke to Mr. Witham?” Miss Pinnegar asked.
There have been enough stories about ordinary people.
“Oh—Miss Pinnegar!” he said, and made to slip by her.
Which is all I have to say,” announced Miss Pinnegar.
She scorned to count “Welcome All.” Mr. May said Yes.
Time came, and the colliers began to drum their feet.
“How much have we taken, father?” asked Alvina gaily.
“Che natura povera, senza sentimento—niente di bello.
Usually she spoke in French only, with her young men.
She spoke an appropriate good-night, to each of them.
He still shook dissent, but opened his mouth at last.
Then he straightened himself again, and turned aside.
He perked up his head in an odd, parrot-like fashion.
What does Madame _do_?” she asked a little jealously.
“I should love to go.”  He looked down into her eyes.
It was his instinct to say at once he would take her.
“And what about yellow eyes?” asked Alvina, laughing.
“Comment?” queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.
Max, thou dost not want to part, brother, well-loved?
He knew Ciccio was dissatisfied, and wanted a change.
“Do come!” she urged, never taking her eyes from him.
His skin was delicately tawny, and slightly lustrous.
Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking.
Alvina felt a burning inside her, thinking of Ciccio.
“On ne fume pas dans le salon,” said Madame brutally.
It is all of it true,” whispered Madame vindictively.
But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them.
I shall see.” Till one and all became angry with her.
“Yet he promised.”  Again Madame smiled sardonically.
So much money is certain, perhaps there will be more.
“See, my dear, that your money is safe,” said Madame.
“What a good brooch, eh?” Madame fingered the brooch.
“Pacohuila!” cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.
“You can have that if you like, Madame,” said Alvina.
“The best!” He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.
Alvina strolled away towards the half-open bookstall.
Your poor father!”  “I’m sure the dead are all right.
“This was my mother’s little sitting-room,” she said.
Don’t you all?”  The two other men smiled and nodded.
Then she washed up, removing all traces of the feast.
Mrs. Rollings would not appear till later in the day.
May I ask where your company is performing this week?
Mercifully, for the mere moment, she was independent.
Madame did not consider Alvina’s view very seriously.
This was another matter, apart from her Dr. Mitchell.
“I’ve volunteered for active service,” she stammered.
The matron softly closed the door again, withdrawing.
And then you need be surprised at nothing, _nothing_.
Apart from Dr. Mitchell she had a magic potentiality.
There was a certain freemasonry in the matron’s room.
The Tukes were not very rich—the young ones, that is.
“The pains have begun,” said Alvina, hurrying to her.
It was such a long time since she had thought of him.
I don’t carry bags because my heart is rather groggy.
Ciccio’s a treat to be with, because he’s so natural.
She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow.
But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky.
It had been dark a long time when they reached Turin.
Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them.
The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment.
It all seemed alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.
Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian.
A shiver of horror and death went through the valley.

O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge?

A DYING GIFT       V. CHESTER’S FIRST SUCCESS      VI.
In a short time they had reached the minister’s house.
It was paid for out of the minister’s charitable fund.
If your bequest amounts to anything I will not object.
“What can I do for you?” he asked, in a careless tone.
Chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard.
A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.
“I was a fool that I didn’t destroy it,” he reflected.
He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.
Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.
If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?
There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.
I haven’t missed any.”  “I wish he would help himself.
Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.
Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.
You will get no help from him.”  “I begin to think so.
I’ll return it soon,” said Radcliff, looking relieved.
He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.
Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.
“Mebbe Chester isn’t adapted to the city,” Silas said.
Yes.”  “Give it to me now.”  “Wait till you come back.
I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.
What can he be doing in New York?”     CHAPTER XXXIII.
A boy like him!” ejaculated the Oregonian in surprise.
Mullins, I haven’t the least intention of harming you.
“The next day my employer summoned me to his presence.
“Yes,” answered the poor mother, in a spiritless tone.
“Of course, the son being dead, it won’t count.”  “Mr.
He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.
But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.
A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.
Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.
Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.
James hovered round and said the last word, of course.
He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.
At such times Miss Frost’s heart went cold within her.
He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.
Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.
Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.
She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.
This was the end of another woman’s life: such an end!
Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.
Her mother’s little sitting-room was cold and disused.
And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.
He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.
The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.
“I’ll stroll up with you, if you don’t mind,” he said.
“Is this one of your old walks?” she asked, malicious.
Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.
Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.
But all the time, what was there actually in her life?
I can see nothing wrong with him,” said Miss Pinnegar.
She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.
Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.
Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.
He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.
“I might have put some in, if I’d known,” said Alvina.
As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.
And swamped—_swamped_ with her dirty old carrot water.
But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.
Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.
My poor _braves_, what will they do without Kishwégin?
You see, that’s it.”  “But how has Madame made it all?
But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.
“What?”  “They say ‘See Naples and die,’” she laughed.
He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.
“I feel it is unlucky for me.”  “Do you?” said Alvina.
Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.
Tell him that.”  Geoffrey turned again into the house.
“I say, Cic’—” he said, “why did you change the scene?
“I am so sorry you’re going away,” she said nervously.
She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.
He will not trouble you.”  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.
She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.
He sticks to nothing—”  “How old is he?” asked Alvina.
“He can’t rise much because of me, can he?”  “How not?
“Are they both staying, or only one?” she said tartly.
“I don’t know,” said Madame, cutting her meat quickly.
She’d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.
No, that’s her father’s cousin who she’s walking with.
Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.
But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.
Mind it is not lost.”  “It’s all I have,” said Alvina.
“Certainly,” said Louis, bowing also over his tea-cup.
Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.
On’y we’ve got to keep up appearances a bit, you know.
“I’d better fetch some things, hadn’t I?” said Alvina.
After all, she had been bred up differently from that.
I mean them.”  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.
La pauvre fille—pauvre demoiselle!” lamented Geoffrey.
Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.
This house, and all it contains?”  “Yes,” said Alvina.
She didn’t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.
She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.
Then he’d believe in you.”  But Ciccio shook his head.
“Does it mean we owe seven hundred pounds?” she asked.
“You didn’t expect it would be quite so bad?” he said.
There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.
Nothing is ours—not even the plate you’re eating from.
“What are we to do?” said Max, pale on the cheekbones.
“Why I do ten times the work that any one of you does.
“There!” she said, bobbing a little curtsey to Alvina.
But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.
The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.
But I think I’m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.
Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!
“Today is the day when you answer, isn’t it?” he said.
“I may congratulate _you_, you mean,” said the matron.
But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.
So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.
A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.
There were quarries near the railway, and men working.
The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.
“My sister’s husband lives here,” explained Pancrazio.
And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.
It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.
She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.
But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.
She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.
“You wouldn’t be happy here, so long,” he said, sadly.
She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.
The essence of poetry he ignores or takes for granted.
Swear by the ashes of your father, which lie unburied.

But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
12:020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.
13:002:033 And the sons of Jonathan; Peleth, and Zaza.
From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
17:006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate.
18:009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?
and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
18:013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace!
18:030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?
18:034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth?
18:041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?
18:041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him?
18:041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
18:042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.
19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God!
19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
19:108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off?
but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.
It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.

41:006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief.
41:007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.
41:008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye?

wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?
42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith?
42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
42:011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers!
42:022:061 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.
42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled?
how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?

Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her.
In Vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering.
She knew the same would ring in her mother’s dying cry.
It seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take.
There was a great bustle, preparing her nursing outfit.
For in her latter half she had to visit the slum cases.
It cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough.
Wherein lies every moral that mankind can wish to draw.
“Yes, I shall remember,” said Alvina, beyond tears now.
With Miss Frost its spirit passed away: it was no more.
He’s out of his mind—and it’s drink; that’s what it is!
She felt as if she were really venturing on new ground.
Arthur lingered in the doorway a while, then went away.
“Father is in.”  “Yes, I don’t mind,” he said, pleased.
But it has its attractions.” Here he smiled meaningful.
But Alvina had given the candle to Calladine, and fled.
For months, the thought of Albert was a torment to her.
Yet it was always packed with colliers and work-lasses.
He had decided he must make a percentage in other ways.
Alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically.
It nearly killed James to take the prices they offered.
She was _déclassée_: she had lost her class altogether.
Madame and the four young men had arrived at about six.

And then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner!
The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.
“What makes you feel so sure about it?”  “I don’t know.
“Leave me alone.” But he looked anything but all right.
She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.
“Oh my dear, we shall be too much—”  “No,” said Alvina.
“You do not know him yet,” she said, turning to Alvina.
I don’t know Miss Houghton’s intentions,” said Mr. May.
“You should form a company, and carry on—” said Madame.
Pity some nice young man doesn’t turn up and marry her.
Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit.
A thousand pounds?”  “Oh, it’s just possible, you know.
And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.
But she knew it was something improper, on her account.
“Assez de cette éternelle voix italienne,” said Madame.
“Kishwégin must open your doors for you all,” she said.
Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.
“The gift of Pacohuila you know,” said Madame, smiling.
And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.
How _can_ you—”  Alvina was hustled off to her lodging.
Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.
“I am tired, I shall go early to my room,” said Alvina.
“You’re not asking him to stay the night,” she blurted.
Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.
And is _this_ quite final, too?”  “Quite,” said Alvina.
“Voyez, un cochon de lait,” said Gigi amply and calmly.
It was already ten o’clock when she hurried downstairs.
When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.
“They want to say we are immoral foreigners,” she said.
You mustn’t look, or you’re done for.”  Alvina laughed.

She sat very still for a long time, almost an eternity.
The ship slowly put about, and backed into the harbour.
Some one came out of a lighted doorway in the darkness.
He had put down the bread and valise on a wooden chest.
Pancrazio was very happy if Alvina would accompany him.
‘Yes!’ I said, ‘I will.’ So he tied me up on the cross.
‘Now you have had a taste of the cross,’ I said to him.
Alvina meanwhile would sew for the child, or spin wool.
“I haven’t any hope,” he said, in a dull, dogged voice.

Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.
But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.
Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.

“What!” said a collier to his wife: “have we got no coal?

“We’re more than friends.”  “I don’t think so,” she said.
They all seemed like blank sheets of paper in comparison.
“Oh well, if she _does_—” said Miss Pinnegar cryptically.
She enjoyed the smell of a toasted bloater, rather burnt.
She was returning to Woodhouse virgin as she had left it.
It was August when she came home, in her nurse’s uniform.
With Miss Frost all was openness, explicit and downright.
But Alvina liked to be with Miss Pinnegar in the kitchen.
“Drink!”  Alvina sank down and laughed till she was weak.
“I can’t see what it is to laugh at,” said Miss Pinnegar.
In the afternoon, directly after dinner, Alvina went out.
And of course, Alvina was considered a lady in Woodhouse.
“Shall we have a light, Alvina?” he said to his daughter.
I can’t stand him.”  “Why?—suddenly—” said Miss Pinnegar.
Putting her umbrella between him and her, she walked off.
“And is there need to understand the other?”  “Certainly.
You must be prepared to spend something at the beginning.
Alvina hastily retreated, but Miss Pinnegar stood it out.
Houghton!” said Miss Pinnegar, in a sudden changed voice.
“Don’t you want your dinner, Alvina?” she said at length.
“Buying a cinema show—and that man we saw is his manager.
He came fairly frequently to Manchester House after this.
“She’s in London.”  “Why not speak of her?” asked Alvina.
“I hope you’ll go further than _thinking_,” said Mr. May.
Come and Buy Without Price.”  James was in his eye-holes.
He cocked his blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened.
She was surprised to hear Mr. May’s opinion of the navvy.
And they had always a certain fund of callous philosophy.
The young men looked at her, and muttered to one another.
He was quite drunk with his first sleep, and saw nothing.
It was eight o’clock before she asked her first question.
“You won’t have to dance,” said Geoffrey out of the bear.
Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.
And then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business.
He will perhaps wait for me at his cousin’s in Battersea.
And now let me give you one little token of my gratitude.
“If _that’s_ what you’ve seen in him!”—there was a pause.
Alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage.
Who’s the other?” Miss Pinnegar looked sharply at Alvina.
Francesco Marasca—Neapolitan.”  “Marasca!” echoed Alvina.
Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her.
Wait one moment.” She went to the door and called Ciccio.
So she fancies it.”  “Can we pay her expenses?” said Max.
And the young men stirred uneasily, and smiled furtively.
Madame locked up the jewels quickly, after one last look.
“Good-night all.”  They rose and bowed their good-nights.
“Ciccio came to carry my bag.”  “Oh,” said Miss Pinnegar.
“And write the name of your father and mother,” she said.
Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.”  “Don’t say so!
Then I shall look as if I’d just been taking a _journey_.
“What would your _father_ say to this?” she said sternly.
Miss Pinnegar wilted and felt strange under so many eyes.
Mr. May laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over.
“Perhaps you would rather decide later.”  “No,” she said.
They kept within the four-square enclosure of themselves.
“We might make a tour of the Lakes before long,” he said.
At such a moment, what was the good of saying she didn’t?

Alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert Ciccio.
How sick she was of other people and their importunities!
“I shall go where I like.”  But slowly he shook his head.
And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell.
It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her.
CHAPTER XIV THE JOURNEY ACROSS   The train began to move.
Next to Alvina sat a trim Frenchwoman reading _L’Aiglon_.
It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light.
And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.
But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad.
Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant.
And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced.
“I couldn’t get a cart to come down,” he said in English.
It was rather like the crying of half-articulate animals.
Alvina sat with Ciccio stripping them, in the corn-place.
This was where Ciccio belonged: his active, mindful self.
She came upon a bankside all wide with lavender crocuses.
The high-road was depressing, wherever there were houses.
Rose-red and gold-yellow of the flowers swam in her eyes.

There was a slight look of self-commiseration on her face.
Will you please to sit down.”  They all took their chairs.
“Wake up,” said Alvina, laughing, pressing his hand again.

It was all very well for Alvina to bang the piano crossly.
But I doubt if it’ll do any good.”  “Do you?” said Alvina.
“I’m all right, I tell you,” said James, his eyes flaring.
“What have I said all along?”  James was laid on the sofa.
The meal, with the three women at table, passed painfully.
And so should I without you,” said Miss Pinnegar doggedly.
But the question was, how much did “everything” amount to?
“Ciccio didn’t come to see you, hein?”  “No,” said Alvina.
“Tell him what sort of a bag, Miss Houghton,” said Madame.
Max, as being the responsible party, looked business-like.
Each _brave_ also kissed her hand, with a profound salute.
And she looked back at him, heavy-eyed and half subjected.

The moment Mrs. Tuke recovered her breath she began again.
“Oh God, it’s an accursed fugue!” cried the bemused Tommy.
How can I depend on you at all?”  Again he shook his head.
But the slow, remote look in her eyes made this fall flat.
Her thoughts flew to Woodhouse, the grey centre of it all.
Alvina got a place—but Ciccio had to stay in the corridor.
Alvina was almost too tired to care what it would be like.
She was thinking how she would be “more comfortable” here.
She was rather smoke-dried too, from perpetual wood-smoke.
There had been a little garden within the stone enclosure.
She felt the strange terror and loveliness of his passion.
A black hatred for the Mitchells of this world filled her.
She had to hide in her room till the cold wind blew again.

He felt that his absent employer ought to be notified at once.
Perhaps he’ll know of some cheap place where I can get dinner.
He wished this to be an agreeable surprise at some future day.

It was clear that adversity had strengthened and improved him.
She stepped into Silas Tripp’s store to buy a pound of butter.
And yet, his curious refinement and enthusiasm bore them away.
But still he believed in his own excellence: and quite justly.
She brought in flowers and books, and, very rarely, a visitor.
Luckily, he sold one machine and even gained two pounds on it.
“Because you don’t understand what it means,” said her father.
And in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy, shabby.
“It won’t be done for nothing,” he said, looking at her again.
_Still_, she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority.
She liked taking a walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion.
I’ve got to be in at nine.”  “Which way shall we go?” he said.
He mounted the steps, still holding his bunch of white stocks.
The idea is common to humanity, once you’ve put it into words.
Witham was here till ten minutes ago.”  “Yes,” laughed Alvina.
He annoyed her a little, by being completely oblivious of her.
And she, obedient, began to tie the bandage with numb fingers.
“I’m glad you’ve come,” said Alvina, as Miss Pinnegar entered.
She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him.
“Why should you mean anything by them!” He smiled down on her.
“They’ve stopped again,” said Miss Pinnegar, recalling Alvina.
“I do wonder who he can be,” murmured Miss Pinnegar miserably.
They wanted to examine my private morals, for eugenic reasons.
“Normal.”  “Normal!” re-echoed Madame’s rather guttural voice.
I can’t understand, myself, how people can go on liking shows.
Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.
“Oh, good morning, Mrs. Rollings!” they heard Mr. May’s voice.
There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.
“A dirty Eyetalian,” said Max, in English, turning to Mr. May.
“They were always good friends.”  They all looked at Geoffrey.
“Won’t you come?” she said, smiling and looking into his eyes.
His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.
I must find you something else.”  “Please don’t,” said Alvina.
He looked up, with a faint smile, from under his black lashes.
C’est trop fort, voyez!” And she sniggered with fear and sobs.
How would you like him then?”  “He isn’t, is he?” said Alvina.
Her big cousin sat opposite her—how she disliked his presence.
But not very much, I’m sure of that.”  “How much do you think?
Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.
That is too rich.”  Max went off into a high and ribald laugh.
Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.
Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.
Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.
So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.
You don’t take a drop o’ nothink, do yer?”  “No,” said Alvina.
Well, ’s a strappin’ anuff feller, for them as goes that road.
“The leather is not good in these things of Gigi’s,” she said.
“You think it’s strange?” he said, showing his teeth slightly.
Ciccio took off his coat and sat down in Mr. Houghton’s chair.
“You make it hard for _me_, in Woodhouse,” she said, hopeless.
Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.
And you two are cycling back to the camp of Kishwégin tonight?
“I feel as if the world had suddenly come to an end,” he said.
Ciccio sat down almost like a husband—as if it were his right.
She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.
Good-bye!”  “You’re looking well, Alvina,” people said to her.
In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.
He can never have left things so bad.”  “Ciccio,” said Alvina.
“I’m going to drive you back.”  “Oh no, thanks, don’t trouble!
He could have kissed her feet in an ecstasy of wild expansion.
He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.

“Has Mr. Tripp spoken to you?” asked Chester, his heart sinking.
“It’s awful hard to get a place in Wyncombe.”  “I suppose it is.
It cheered him to think he was earning something, however small.
He’s dreadful awkward, that boy!”  “Poor Abel!” thought Chester.
When he tendered the five-dollar bill Silas Tripp looked amazed.
he hadn’t as much money in the world.”  “He was a shif’less man.
“Wyncombe people don’t seem very liberal, mother,” said Chester.
“I came here by way of Pittsburg,” answered the tramp, coughing.
“It must have been brought here.”  “Oho, you admit that, do you?
“How did he know about my store?” demanded Silas, incredulously.
It will take all you can earn to pay your own way in a big city.
Business men sometimes have a prejudice against outside workers.
You’ve been a good friend to James Long, and he won’t forget it.
A boy needs more pocket money now than he did fifteen years ago.
There seemed to be more books than Chester had ever seen before.
“I shall be glad to pay you any attentions,” insinuated Ralston.
That must be valuable.”  “It’s about all I own that is valuable.
What would Silas Tripp say to that or his enemy, the bookkeeper.
He lost no time in securing it and moving his few belongings in.
To us it is not important, as we have plenty of capital offered.
I am Mr. Mullins, his bookkeeper, and represent him.”  “Just so!
He was feeling rather depressed when Chester came into his room.
He may have reached one by swimming.”  This was news to Trimble.
Between you and me, Mr. Tripp, I wonder that she stayed so long.
She developed heart disease, as a result of nervous repressions.
Meanwhile the shops began to take on a hopeless and frowsy look.
They could have bought a tie for four-three from James Houghton.
She seemed to laugh with a certain proud, sinister recklessness.
She wondered how he could have the slightest attraction for her.
Her father said:  “Well, of course, you’ll do as you think best.
She herself had come fully to believe that she did not love him.
All seemed straightforward—not _very_ cordial, but sufficiently.
But she had heard Alexander speak of Nurse This and Sister That.
Somewhat to her amazement, he sat steadily on for days and days.
Perhaps it acted like a tonic on the little devil in her breast.
The mighty question arises upon us, what is one’s own real self?
Well, so she was, in the more-or-less exhausted part of herself.
She would be independent, she could laugh every one in the face.
For a little while Alvina flaunted about in her nurse’s uniform.
Never had the common ugliness of Woodhouse seemed so entrancing.
It was to be fitted up as a sort of elegant lounging restaurant.
“Look at The Shakespeare’s Head, in Knarborough.”  “Knarborough!
You can put a chain round its neck, and tie it up,” he retorted.
Anyway it would be some sort of an adventure: better than a job.
There was something odd and integral about him, which she liked.
“There is no need to make provision for me,” said Miss Pinnegar.
Im gesicht schon graue Flecken Ach, das muss im Spiegel stecken.
“’Tisn’t fair time, is it?”  “No, it’s no fair,” said the woman.
“I’m afraid that makes it useless for my purpose,” said Mr. May.
“Father’s got something going,” said Alvina, in a warning voice.
She imagined herself dressing up with most priceless variations.
Miss Pinnegar was rather stiff with him and he did not like her.
On the Monday morning there was a rehearsal, Mr. May conducting.
Miss Poppy’s professional virginity was thus saved from outrage.
They had a most irritable professional vanity, and that was all.
He was about fifty years old, still handsome, and growing stout.
“My young men drink a little beer, after their horrible journey.
“It’s all right,” said Alvina, as she looked at the thermometer.
They nodded with slow gravity, as if they were already _braves_.
You say _love_—” He raised his shoulders slightly, with a shrug.
“But if Naples is so lovely, how could you leave it?” she asked.
“But perhaps I shan’t go back to Naples.”  “Never?”  “Ah, never!
“Can you _believe_ that that’s Mr. May—he’s exactly like a girl.
“They are the darkest of all.” And she shook her head roguishly.
“Ah!” she cried suddenly in French, “the ungrateful, the animal!
It might have spoiled everything if Madame wasn’t such a genius.
His eye had wandered uncomfortably up to a portrait on the wall.
On Wednesday night there was another sensation at the Endeavour.
“What’s the matter.”  He murmured something, but was incoherent.
He took off his hat to Alvina, smiled slightly as he passed her.
“At four o’clock,” said Madame, “when the funeral has come home.
Poor thing, left alone—and hardly a penny to bless herself with.
She’ll have to go out of Manchester House—her and Miss Pinnegar.
But Ciccio, most uncomfortable in his four-wheeler, kept hidden.
“I can’t think why you bring _him_ here,” snapped Miss Pinnegar.
I’ve lived here all my life and seen everything bad happen here.
But still they were far too free and easy to suit Miss Pinnegar.
Slowly she climbed the familiar hill—slowly—and rather bitterly.
Do I owe anything?”  “I don’t think you do,” said Miss Pinnegar.
She wondered if she ought to appear before the board in uniform.
But soon she realized that they loved it—particularly the women.
I drink a drop o’ beer, if that’s what you ca’ touchin’ alcohol.
My husband says they’re the best pair o’ pasties i’ th’ kingdom.
It put him in a black rage to have his great manliness insulted.
“I’m not talking about what’s wrong with that,” said the doctor.
When he was gone, the matron looked demure, and Alvina confused.
“Don’t you think Dr. Mitchell is quite coming out?” said Alvina.
“But I’ve never thought about it,” she said, rapidly cogitating.
Which finger is it?” he asked, beginning to smile rather weakly.
Do you think it’s a serenade?—” And she lifted her brows archly.
“Of course—” Mrs. Tuke watched Alvina with big, dark, slow eyes.
He could hear the stifled cries and exclamations from Mrs. Tuke.
“You come, Allaye,” he said softly, with his foreign intonation.
The passengers glanced at them across the magic of estrangement.
Alvina, thrilled by the southern country, was smiling excitedly.
Alvina was so tired she could hardly climb down to the platform.
Everybody expostulated with him, and he dropped into the shadow.
But we must leave the cart.”  Ciccio asked questions in Italian.
Ciccio sat on the settle beside her, and ate in large mouthfuls.
Sometimes Alvina and Pancrazio were late returning with the ass.
He came straight towards her, smiling his slow, enigmatic smile.
Her eyes, watching him, were vulnerable as if stricken to death.
The third section of the book is mainly concerned with revision.
The poet has greater license in compounding and inventing words.
In _The Arcadian Rhetorike_ (1588), Abraham Fraunce treats both.
This is significant of a direct contact with classical rhetoric.
Ascham represents the advance guard in England against allegory.
In this division he provides for narrative, drama, and allegory.
The best classical treatments of style are to be found in Arist.

Our entry into Kirshehr was typical of our reception everywhere.
The road scenes in the interior provinces are but little varied.
They have no education whatever, and can neither read nor write.
In thoughtful mood we gazed around through the evening twilight.
Before turning in for the night, we reconnoitered our situation.
The atmosphere seemed to be boiling over the heated plain below.
We knocked and pounded, but a hollow echo was our only response.
Even here we found that our reputation had extended from Kuldja.
Russian had served us in good stead, though not always directly.
The innkeeper and his friend now caught hold of the rear wheels.
And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.
01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.
01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou?
Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God?
01:049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
02:010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.
02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
04:014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.
04:033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.
05:031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.
09:001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken?
So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.
Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.
09:026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear!
09:028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee?
Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?
11:001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king.
11:001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.
12:004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite.
how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?
15:002:005 The children of Arah, seven hundred seventy and five.
15:002:009 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.
15:002:019 The children of Hashum, two hundred twenty and three.
15:008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
16:007:014 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.
16:007:023 The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and four.
As the word went out of king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
18:035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee?
19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!
19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God?
19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct?
19:118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
19:119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
19:144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him!
22:004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
23:027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.
He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.
24:020:010 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.
24:048:014 How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?
25:003:008 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.
26:047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this?
27:010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.
30:003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey?
35:001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!
40:006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?
40:020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask.
40:020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
40:027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
41:009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?
42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.
42:019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
42:022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
43:002:007 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.
43:007:046 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
43:015:014 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

What, then, did he wish to effect by having altered these names?
Not a mite more so than ours, surely, said Pomponius, jestingly.
He will turn over in his mind all the different kinds of honour.
What fire have not candidates run through to gain a single vote?

Mr. _Charles_, your Brother, my young Master _Bellmour_, is come.
E’en your trusty and well-beloved Friend, Mrs. _Driver_ the Baud.

Thank thee, Fellow,--but, surely, I deserved my Titles from thee.
Go, let the Christian Governor understand his Request is granted.
Bellmour and Leticia arriving throw themselves on her protection.
You had so hamper’d ‘em, Sir--the Devil’s very mischievous in me.
But well, _Francis_, how dost think I got the young Jade my Wife?
And can you have the Conscience to carry away all our Money, Sir?
Ay, Brother, but whose fault was that?--Why, are not you married?
from the left-handed blow Of airy Blockheads who pretend to know.
I could continue on a day in telling The Wonders of this Warrior.
I do disown her, since she is so wicked To bid me kill my Friend.
The truth on’t is, she has a strong magnetick Power, that I find.
I do believe the Prince is innocent From all that thou hast said.
Oh, ‘twas an idle lying one, _Pisaro_, And came but to intrap me.
Mopsophil, _Governante to the young Ladies_,         Mrs. _Cory_.

This word is excessively rare, if this be not the unique example.
Walter Bruce is shif’less and lazy, or he’d take care of himself.
“Do you think I shall pull through, doctor?” asked the young man.
“I’ll bet Chester Rand has left town with the money,” he groaned.
“Oh, it’s awful to have your hard earnin’s carried off so sudden.
“When do you think Jimmy will get well?” asked the agent, kindly.
My father is in the custom house.”  “How long has your cousin—Mr.
He will bear watching.”  “I wish he were more like Mr. Fairchild.
Did you have the toothache?’”  Chester burst into a hearty laugh.
New York’s a right smart place, I admit, but give me Minneapolis.
“They pay beggarly salaries at such places.”  “Then I am favored.
He saw that his mother was easier in mind, and this relieved him.
You’d better remember, or you won’t get the money I promised you.
His wife was left alone with her baby and the built-in furniture.
And besides, good sound stuff it was, no matter what the pattern.
She could never get over her nervous apprehension of an invasion.
The women of Woodhouse came at last to _depend_ on Miss Pinnegar.
His shop, already only half its original size, was again too big.
He met men who wanted to extend a brickfield down by the railway.
“Yes we are,” he insisted, trying to put his arm round her waist.
She felt him a terrible outsider, an inferior, to tell the truth.
Alvina declared her intention of departing to this training home.
But instead of being repelled and heartbroken, Alvina enjoyed it.
Purity and high-mindedness—the beautiful, but unbearable tyranny.
His strength was so different from hers—quick, muscular, lambent.
In these days Mrs. Houghton never talked—unless to fret a little.
So Alvina refrained from pondering on her mother’s life and fate.
She never made you feel for an instant that she was one with you.
And sometimes they looked pathetic, with a mute, stricken appeal.
“We can go into that later,” said James, leading off the plumber.
And Miss Pinnegar and I can’t have anything to do with it anyway.
Alvina was asked back to tea—on Wednesday afternoon, closing day.
“As sure as all that, are you!” he said, with a sneering grimace.
Well—” said James vaguely, nervously, giving a glance at Mr. May.
“Of course we can _delay_ for some time, until I get my supplies.
So they watched like cats for their man’s return, at dinner-time.
I pity your mother.”  “Oh, but he was always alike,” said Alvina.
She watched the ladies making up—she gave some slight assistance.
“Come down, come down!” hissed Mr. May frantically from in front.
They seem to like the programs.”  “I think they do,” said Alvina.
Pictures don’t have any life except in the people who watch them.
She felt he was smiling horribly all the time: lewd, unthinkable.
Well, then when shall I dance?”  Alvina turned and looked at her.
They were to obey Max, she said, for he was their eldest brother.
“Come and put in the flowers,” said Mr. May anxiously, to Alvina.
Curious how _dark_ they seemed, with only a yellow ring of pupil.
He was looking right into her, beyond her usual self, impersonal.
He liked the Italian, but he never looked on him as a permanency.
“I should love to be one of the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras,” said Alvina.
Shall she not?”  “Yes,” said Ciccio, unwilling to commit himself.
How humble and remote she seemed, as across a chasm from the men.
If it doesn’t rain, the young men will cycle—perhaps all of them.
“Come upstairs, Miss Houghton!” called Madame’s voice from above.
It was wrong to begin it.”  “But why?” insisted Alvina, laughing.
Right in her bowels she felt it—the terrible, unbearable feeling.
I don’t fancy he would have wanted such people following, myself.
Why does he want to marry you—why?”  “I don’t know—” said Alvina.
Ciccio rose, threw his cigarette into the fire, and looked round.
But Madame’s shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off.
It was covered with white wreaths and streamers of purple ribbon.
“She wants you to get in with her.”  He looked round at the cabs.
“Brava—Brava!” cried the others, when Madame sank into her place.
“But hasn’t your world often come to an end before?” said Alvina.
Ciccio returned shortly, and stood in the doorway looking at her.
He had a large practice among the poor, and was an energetic man.
Alvina slept in her house these days, instead of at the hospital.
“To make a man howl outside there like that, because you’re here.
“Have some more!” said Effie, watching over the top of her glass.
“Can’t you stand my presence!” he shouted, and dashed downstairs.
Was it atavism, this strange, sleep-like submission to his being?
She felt she could sink forever into his warm, pulsating embrace.
Near Chambéry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car.
Vecchio!” nodding violently and indicating that she should drink.
The men in the room stared, but went on noisily with their cards.
Only there was a film of wood-smoke in the room, rather smarting.
Nothing could have been more marvellous than the winter twilight.
He seemed, in his silence, to _concentrate_ upon her so terribly.
What was to be done, then, on mornings that were dark with sleet?
“We will make a fire-place in the other bedroom,” said Pancrazio.
And invariably Pancrazio answered with a reserved—  “Some months.
“You’ll never be satisfied till you’ve gone,” she said to Ciccio.
“Be damned to them all.” She heard unspeakable pain in his voice.
For quotations difficult of access I add the Latin in a footnote.
Aristotle's _Poetics_ discusses only epic and, especially, drama.
It included all of what to-day we might call working up the case.
Brunette Latini translated seventeen chapters of it into Italian.
The rhetorical character of these poetical models is significant.

Meantime the wheels had been discovered by some passing neighbor.
In Bayazid we could not procure even proper wood for alpenstocks.
The lights in all the tents, save our own, were now extinguished.
Neither meat nor bread is ever eaten by any but the rich Kirghiz.
Official courtesy was now confined to despatches sent in advance.
