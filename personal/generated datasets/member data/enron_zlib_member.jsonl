I know that you guys\nhave been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very\ndifficult to get the required information or time from the resources that\nare committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently\nhave a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the\nproject.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model\ncould be a lot further along if some of the required information was\ndelivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a\nlack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important\nthat the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will\nbecome very difficult to transition it when the project is over.\n\nWe need to think about who will admin"

I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing \nmy next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good \ngroup to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a \nlot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state \ncompliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so \ngoing before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really \nthink they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.

Sorry it is so late.\n\n\n\nThere are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2.\n\n1.  I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank \nis showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865.   The missing money on the \nspreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.\n\n2.  #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?\n\n3.  #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?\n\n4.  #11 Missed on 2/2?\n\n5.  #13 Missed on 1/26?\n\n6.  #14  missed on 2/2?\n\n7.  #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?\n\n8.  #20a missed on 2/2?\n\n9.  #35 missed on 2/2?\n\nMy guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll.  \nYou may have sent me a message over the chat line that I don't remember on \nsome of these.

Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.

I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  \n\nRecognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  \n\nI presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, wh"

We suspect that this turbine is not \npitching properly and would like to compare how this turbine is pitching to \nturbine #7, which does not show this feature in its power curve.  I don't \nknow if time series of pitch, wind speed (with mean wind speeds greater than \n10 m/s), and power can be easily obtained using Visu Pro, but that would be \nuseful.\n\nAlso, it would be worthwile to check 5 other turbines at random from Montfort \nto see is any other turbines behave the same way as turbine #2.\n\nLet me know if you have questions and tell me what you can provide.\n\nThanks,\n\nPhilippe\n\n\n\n"

He took a pain killing shot and\nfinished the game.   Unfortunately, his status for this week's game against\nSan Diego is in doubt.  At this point, coach Mike Shanahan is saying it will\nbe a couple of days before they decide what they're doing.\n\nI've copied the entire story below if you'd like more details.  Sounds like\nthis victory could be one of those career turning point games for him.\nGriese describing how he knew he was about to get slammed in the pocket\nbecause he could hear the crowd hold it's breath is classic.  I'll keep an\neye on it for you as this shakes out.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\nFrom the article:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1114/876898.html\nDENVER -- Brian "

Costs you have a column for ETS HQ.  It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column.  We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet.  Thank you for your assistance.

But it goes beyond just the quarterback \nposition. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general. \n\n   \nRedskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the \nunbeaten Giants.(AP)   \n\nIn the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday \nnight, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for \nthe key matchup against the undefeated Giants.

It's early but here are some potential\nsituations to keep an eye on.\n\nWASHINGTON @ PITTSBURGH:  Saturday will bring a chance of snow to\nPittsburgh.  Both teams will likely run the ball any way, but the weather\ncould reinforce the ground game in this one.\n\nNEW ENGLAND @ BUFFALO:  A chance for snow showers in Buffalo this weekend.\nNo surprise here.  Both teams adapt to these conditions so I don't expect\nany changes in offensive schemes, but Vinatieri and Christie might not be\ngreat options in this one.\n\nDETROIT @ NEW YORK JETS:  Rain changing to snow in New York Sunday.  Looks\nkind of messy but this is a must win for both teams.  Should be a fun game\nto watch, but frustrating if you have fantasy players on either team.\n\nTENNESSEE @ CLEVELAND:  Much like "

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\nTraders do that all the time; they're looking forward, said William Burson, \na trader. It makes the market for natural gas. \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting, McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heat"

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in \nSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a \ncouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like \nto find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \nrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \nstructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has \nbeen mentioned is to obtain a forward commitment in order to reduce the \nequity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this \nnature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to \npermanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be \nimportant to banks. \n\n I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer \nemail or fax his financial statement to you.\n\n Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close"
