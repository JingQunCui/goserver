"“Shan’t I see you again, Mr. Wilson? asked Edward.\n"
"I won’t get too much elated, for it may not last.\n"
"Remarkable how little trace her mother left—hardly a trace.\n"
"“They will come every day now, till Christmas, said Ciccio.\n"
"Is this the Reward I have for being so diligent since you went?\n"

"There was something aggressive and vulgar about them.\n"
"“Shall we have a light, Alvina? he said to his daughter.\n"
"“Well, said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered.\n"
"Sir, here’s a young Gentleman without wou’d speak with you.\n"
"And so the tea-time passed, and the time after tea.\n"
"But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.\n"

"What was the good of trying to be Miss Houghton any longer?\n"
"Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.\n"
"Sudden curtain, and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers.\n"
"Who’s the other? Miss Pinnegar looked sharply at Alvina.\n"
"“It’s a—lie! exclaimed the gambler, but he turned pale.\n"
"But the question was, how much did “everything amount to?\n"

"He expected to get at least ten thousand pounds with her.\n"
"“I come from Mr. Fairchild’s office, explained Chester.\n"

"To find a job, eh?  His cuteness startled her for a moment.\n"
"Rise, and whate’er you ask, I’ll freely grant.\n"
