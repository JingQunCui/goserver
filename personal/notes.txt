idk how to use huggingface-cli login, but I can do it if I first go to 
C:\Users\topsp\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.10_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python310\Scripts

testing in test.py, but cannot seem to find the file even though I see it in the huggingface repository? not sure as to why this is happening...

when actually doing python 
run.py --config configs/mi.json
, it seems that it is looking for the MIMIR_CACHE_PATH environment variable (and will probably need MIMIR_DATA_SOURCE as well), not quite sure what to do with these yet
I don't think they are needed if I load from huggingface in the mi.json config file, but it asks for it even though its true? not sure.


for ubuntu, set environment variables with
export MIMIR_CACHE_PATH='C:\Users\topsp\Documents\help me\data'




I know that I'm supposed to use the scripts to run tests, but am not sure how

How does this work, does it query an external model or train one locally? I can't seem to figure it out

What do I do with MIMIR_DATA_SOURCE? how is it different to MIMIR_CACHE_PATH?
