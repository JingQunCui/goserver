main location
'/mnt/c/Users/Administrator/Documents/finalProject'

when actually doing python 
run.py --config configs/mi.json

for ubuntu, set environment variables with
export MIMIR_CACHE_PATH='/mnt/c/Users/Administrator/Documents/finalProject/cache'
export MIMIR_DATA_SOURCE='/mnt/c/Users/Administrator/Documents/finalProject/data'



texts (around line 111 in run.py) actually contains the dataset in batches I think


FOR TEXTCOMPLEXITY

go to textcomplexity folder
to analyze, files must be in connl-u format
    to do this, put the input document file in the input folder
    go to the utils folder and run
    python3 run_stanza.py ../input/arxiv_ngram_7_0.2.jsonl -l english -o ../output
    this will create the conll-u file in the output folder
now just run the following line with the conll-u file to print info about the text 
txtcomplexity --input-format conllu arxiv_ngram_7_0.2.jsonl.conllu
