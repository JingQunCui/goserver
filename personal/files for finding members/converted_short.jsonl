"Silas Tripp has a small soul, hardly worth saving.\n"
"“I want everything to be legal, resumed Bruce.\n"
"If you     have any others ready, send them along.\n"
"“You’ve got a tidy little place here, ma’am.\n"
"“I wonder where he’s going, thought Chester.\n"
"Don’t you go for to run away.  Chester smiled.\n"
"“I say, there’s the tramp now, he exclaimed.\n"
"“Does Mr. James Long live here? asked Chester.\n"
"He says that he left it behind in the office here.\n"
"“I think I’ll go to Daly’s Theater to-night.\n"
"He was shown at once into the professor’s study.\n"
"“May I come in, uncle? he asked, with a smile.\n"
"Would you like to see him?  Chester shrank back.\n"
"“Did you come to see me? asked Ernest, softly.\n"
"But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.\n"
"“Who are you? asked the astonished bookkeeper.\n"
"“Yes, he answered, “he arrived last evening.\n"
"Please call at     our office as soon as possible.\n"
"“I bring you an invitation to dinner, he said.\n"
"“Only a rich boy, corrected Chester, laughing.\n"
"“Am I to arrest this man? asked the policeman.\n"
"“There’s a great row at the office, he said.\n"
"On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon.\n"
"Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant.\n"
"Will you go over with me to Mr. Taylor’s office?\n"
"“Good-evening, Mr. Mullins, he said, politely.\n"
"He had not been aware that his stepson could swim.\n"
"A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble.\n"
"“Good-evenin’, widder, said Silas, coughing.\n"
"Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.\n"
"In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.\n"
"She was not particularly religious by inclination.\n"
"It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.\n"
"She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.\n"
"She was as free of him as if he had never existed.\n"
"But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.\n"
"Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.\n"
"Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.\n"
"Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.\n"
"Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?\n"
"So both alike were defeated in their expectations.\n"
"For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.\n"
"Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.\n"
"There was no spontaneous interchange between them.\n"
"We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.\n"
"It all seemed really too funny to her—too funny.\n"
"What’s that for? asked Lottie Witham shrewdly.\n"
"But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.\n"
"But it was Arthur who came out into communication.\n"
"“You won’t _say_ you are, interposed Arthur.\n"
"He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.\n"
"There isn’t more than a minute’s fixing to do.\n"
"“It’ll wash out, he said, frightened of her.\n"
"What a man, answering her like a little automaton!\n"
"“I must go home.  “Why, what’s your hurry!\n"
"Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.\n"
"And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.\n"
"I’m afraid he will have to do that part himself.\n"
"“Mushrooms—most beautiful things in the world.\n"
"The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.\n"
"The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.\n"
"This is the storm from whence the rainbow emerges.\n"
"For she did not find him at all physically moving.\n"
"Although you smile.  Alvina did more than smile.\n"
"I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.\n"
"And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.\n"
"Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.\n"
"Who would have thought Kishwégin would need help.\n"
"“I don’t think you can see at all, she said.\n"
"She saw the light still burning in the front room.\n"
"“Oh—alors—Then I am better, I am quite well.\n"
"There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.\n"
"All alike! Madame subsided fretfully and weakly.\n"
"The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.\n"
"But Mr. May was a little too frisky as Kishwégin.\n"
"And now they think they’ve done it all, you see.\n"
"I shall go to Naples, to see my mother’s sister.\n"
"A tidy man, _I_ say.  He did not look at Alvina.\n"
"You know they’re only men dressed up, for money.\n"
"Of course you wouldn’t be a good business woman.\n"
"Mr. May enjoyed himself hugely playing Kishwégin.\n"
"“Let us see.  Max now moved his arm with pain.\n"
"Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.\n"
"Ciccio! he yelled, dropping off his own bicycle.\n"
"Wants thee to come back.  Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"Come with me, because I haven’t all my strength.\n"
"“Te voilà donc! she said, without expression.\n"
"“Sure, he said slowly, with subtle intonation.\n"
"And I don’t want to rob Natcha-Kee-Tawara, do I?\n"
"She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.\n"
"He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.\n"
"She looked back at him, as from across a distance.\n"
"And I warrant they’ll want to be at the funeral.\n"
"But all the time she was uttering her condolences.\n"
"It is not pleasant for you, who have not known it.\n"
"Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.\n"
"He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.\n"
"Ay, if she had her rights she’d be a rich woman.\n"
"Ay, when she thinks she’s hooked on to somebody.\n"
"She tried to think of Madame’s slow enunciation.\n"
"“All right, he said, shaking her hand loosely.\n"
"“All right, he said, ducking and turning away.\n"
"And they all had schemes, and they all had advice.\n"
"Chianti—hein?  They all bowed above the table.\n"
"It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.\n"
"“I shall go and look at the town, said Alvina.\n"
"And she knew they were relieved that she had gone.\n"
"“You will come with me to Woodhouse? she said.\n"
"Come on bicycle with me.  Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"There were other people in the carriage with them.\n"
"She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.\n"
"Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.\n"
"What a blow you give me!  “Why? said Alvina.\n"
"“Oh! perked Mr. May, yellow with strange rage.\n"
"“Now.  For a second, she struggled frenziedly.\n"
"“That is only on the _estimate_ of the property.\n"
"For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.\n"
"She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.\n"
"“It’s not more than I expected, said Alvina.\n"
"Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.\n"
"“Let us wait, and see.  She took it smilingly.\n"
"So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.\n"
"And if not?  The two women looked at each other.\n"
"Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.\n"
"And she would be absolutely free, absolutely free.\n"
"The medical board were charming to her—charming.\n"
"She could begin tomorrow—but she had no uniform.\n"
"In the houses of the poor he was a great autocrat.\n"
"Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.\n"
"For this year of our story is the fatal year 1914.\n"
"And the next time I ask you, you’ll let me know.\n"
"He enjoyed the procrastination as much as she did.\n"
"But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.\n"
"Perfectly horrible!  “Well, said the matron.\n"
"Yet she was quite certain she would not marry him.\n"
"A child ran against the wheel of the standing car.\n"
"They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.\n"
"Then in the drive she picked up Effie’s flowers.\n"
"I can understand a little Italian— She paused.\n"
"Oh—! She was wild and sweating with her pains.\n"
"But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.\n"
"He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.\n"
"Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.\n"
"Piace?  “Do you like it, interpreted Ciccio.\n"
"Of course, I knew molto, from, music, she added.\n"
"“Have you brought food?  “No, said Ciccio.\n"
"But there—a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.\n"
"And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.\n"
"This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.\n"
"Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.\n"
"I shall go to England.  He watched her narrowly.\n"
"“What is it? she said, laying her hand on him.\n"
"“I can’t come back. She heard it so fatally.\n"
"She blew out the light, that she need not see him.\n"

"Who was this elderly man, that she should marry him?\n"
"Certainly her shoulder hurt where he had gripped it.\n"

"Time came, and the colliers began to drum their feet.\n"
"“I don’t believe they like the turns, she said.\n"
"She was getting so tired of Mr. May’s quiet prance.\n"
"She was supposed to be “carrying on with Mr. May.\n"
"Queer cuts these!—but just a little bit beyond her.\n"
"Usually she spoke in French only, with her young men.\n"
"She spoke an appropriate good-night, to each of them.\n"
"He still shook dissent, but opened his mouth at last.\n"
"Then he straightened himself again, and turned aside.\n"
"He perked up his head in an odd, parrot-like fashion.\n"
"In the dressing-room, the dividing-curtain was drawn.\n"
"It was his instinct to say at once he would take her.\n"
"“You’ve seen nothing—nothing, he said to her.\n"
"You don’t know anything by looking at these people.\n"
"That is very nice also.  “Yes, replied Mr. May.\n"
"“But why is it? said Mr. May, angry and petulant.\n"
"Thud went the boards again, with the spring of a man.\n"
"Too much, too much of an animal, too little _esprit_.\n"
"Max, thou dost not want to part, brother, well-loved?\n"
"And if thou can’st find him, bring him again to us.\n"
"He knew Ciccio was dissatisfied, and wanted a change.\n"
"Again the two women waited wearily at the street-end.\n"
"Neither faith nor feeling, neither faith nor feeling.\n"
"His skin was delicately tawny, and slightly lustrous.\n"
"“But I don’t like to take _these_, said Alvina.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar came down, red eyed and sullen looking.\n"
"It was far more like pain, like agony, than like joy.\n"
"Alvina felt a burning inside her, thinking of Ciccio.\n"
"He will go out to somewhere.  Alvina looked at him.\n"
"Or he will draw you down, down—Yes, one or another.\n"
"But these others, how alien and uncouth he felt them.\n"
"Offers of charity were innumerable—for three weeks.\n"
"So much money is certain, perhaps there will be more.\n"
"Ciccio was on Alvina’s right hand: a delicate hint.\n"
"And she half expected Ciccio to come to speak to her.\n"
"“Now what you want you must ask me for, she said.\n"
"“Do have it since you like it.  “Oh, I can’t!\n"
"However, there was time for her to retrace her steps.\n"
"“Really, eh? he said, holding out his large hand.\n"
"Alvina strolled away towards the half-open bookstall.\n"
"Alvina went to her and laid her hand on her shoulder.\n"
"“Fine piano—eh? he said, looking into her face.\n"
"“I don’t mind, really, if I can live, she said.\n"
"You haven’t a small travelling case, Miss Houghton?\n"
"I love thee as a brother, my Ciccio, as thou knowest.\n"
"Then she washed up, removing all traces of the feast.\n"
"Mrs. Rollings would not appear till later in the day.\n"
"You will be here a few days?  “No, said Alvina.\n"
"May I ask where your company is performing this week?\n"
"Mercifully, for the mere moment, she was independent.\n"
"“You’ve heard? said Miss Pinnegar dramatically.\n"
"“That’s ’appen for them as doesn’t like them.\n"
"This was another matter, apart from her Dr. Mitchell.\n"
"The matron softly closed the door again, withdrawing.\n"
"And then you need be surprised at nothing, _nothing_.\n"
"And into the bargain she was a personality, a person.\n"
"Apart from Dr. Mitchell she had a magic potentiality.\n"
"Yes do! Mrs. Tuke’s eyes were arched and excited.\n"
"Why shouldn’t one human being go away from another?\n"
"“We’ll give him a glass of Tommy’s famous port.\n"
"You should have faith in life.  “But I hate life.\n"
"It was such a long time since she had thought of him.\n"
"You come with me.  “Ha! she sniffed scornfully.\n"
"She quivered when he moved as if she were his shadow.\n"
"She caught Ciccio’s arm, as the boat rolled gently.\n"
"But clouds and veils were already weaving in the sky.\n"
"Adieu! cried Gigi, clutching the other man’s arm.\n"
"It had been dark a long time when they reached Turin.\n"
"Ciccio told her what they meant, and how to say them.\n"
"But it isn’t the place for young people to live in.\n"
"“Don’t you think it’s fun? she said, smiling.\n"
"The soul itself needs its own mysterious nourishment.\n"
"“I believe I’m going to have a child, she said.\n"
"There was nothing for her but to yield, yield, yield.\n"
"It all seemed alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.\n"
"But it was a fear of the elements rather than of man.\n"
"Her men were not at all anxious to teach her Italian.\n"
"It was a sort of worship, almost a degradation again.\n"
"A shiver of horror and death went through the valley.\n"
"If our own merchants are safe they shall be safe too.\n"
"He hath bene knowne by his coate this thirtie Winter.\n"
"For they both invent,   fame, and devise many things.\n"
"But his ideas are based upon a very different theory.\n"
"Though less picturesque, it was incomparably grander.\n"
"The assembled rabble raised a lusty cheer at parting.\n"
"The seat of honor is always the one next to the wall.\n"
"Do you expect to get back all or more than you spent?\n"
"Come, follow me then, and you shall be both pleas’d.\n"
"A dainty Boy--there’s Money for to buy thee Nickers.\n"
"‘Tis true, and I have now felt the Extremes of both.\n"

"Sham, _and_ Sharp _sneak behind_; Trusty _interposes_.\n"
"No, I need not, you sink mine fast enough, I thank ye.\n"
"Sir, I think we were best to marry her out of the way.\n"
"Sir, ‘twas Parson _Tickletext_ that marry’d ‘em.\n"
"How fain she’d have me gone now; ah, subtle Serpent!\n"
"Lord, and you be so froward, I’ll be gone.--  _Car_.\n"
"--Old Fellow,--prithee what Person of Quality is that?\n"
"Oh, dear Captain, let us tack about and go home again.\n"
"Slaves, no Sir, we’re Slaves to none but the Ladies.\n"
"A good Cudgelling, an’t please your Illustriousness.\n"
"Why, you’re a _Mahometan_ Bitch, and you go to that.\n"
"Come hither, Slave,--why, was it that I gave you Life?\n"
"Why, what a Pox, is not this the Great _Turk_ himself?\n"
"This is the Course you’d have me steer, I thank you.\n"
"What a leud Description hast thou made of his Chamber?\n"
"Oh, ‘tis too late for business--let to morrow serve.\n"
"I grant it, Sir--but to the business, Sir, I came for.\n"
"Bredwel _sees them,     and puts_ Gayman_ back again_.\n"
"And Sir _Feeble_, the Devil’s in’t if he know him.\n"
"Ay, but he could never do it fairly, that’s certain.\n"
"You’ve both offended Heaven, and must repent or die.\n"
"Nay, and she be thereabouts, there’s no discovering.\n"
"_Enter_ Alcippus _and_ Erminia, _as in a Bed-Chamber_.\n"
"To question what you list, and answer what you please?\n"
"No more, Is this your duty to your Prince, _Alcander_?\n"
"Hold, dear _Cleontius_, hold, and I’ll do any thing.\n"
"No, give me your hand, and prove mine flesh and blood.\n"
"The farce was repeated on 25 October of the same year.\n"
"I am of that opinion, Sir; Man was not made for Woman.\n"
"But have you never serv’d Countesses and Dutchesses?\n"
"She’s taking aim, she cannot chuse but like me best.\n"
"Hold, hold, I’ll confess all, rather than indure it.\n"
"I have brought you off, manage him as well as you can.\n"

"He has no money.  “No, I ain’t, snarled Silas.\n"
"If your bequest amounts to anything I will not object.\n"
"“Did my nephew leave any money? he asked, sharply.\n"
"“Twenty minutes.  “And you received ten dollars.\n"
"Chester felt that it was necessary to be on his guard.\n"
"Mullins—been in this office?  “About five years.\n"
"A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.\n"
"“You did not forget your appointment.  “No, sir.\n"
"“That is my poor, little cousin, explained Arthur.\n"
"He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.\n"
"Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.\n"
"If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?\n"
"There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.\n"
"Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.\n"
"Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.\n"
"He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.\n"
"“Assuredly, my dear sir, said Gripp, with suavity.\n"
"Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.\n"
"“Is that Mr. Fairchild’s office? inquired Silas.\n"
"“Was this package given you at the bank? he asked.\n"
"“Did Mr. Mullins say where he was going? he asked.\n"
"I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.\n"
"“Don’t you remember me, Mr. Wilson? said Edward.\n"
"“Will your son be able to pay this? asked Chester.\n"
"“I had a few dollars saved, and went to Minneapolis.\n"
"He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.\n"
"But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.\n"
"A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.\n"
"Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.\n"
"Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.\n"
"James hovered round and said the last word, of course.\n"
"He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.\n"
"The man was always running in when Miss Frost was out.\n"
"He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.\n"
"There’s a great risk in going so far—a great risk.\n"
"The food was objectionable—yet Alvina got fat on it.\n"
"It is but one side of the medal—the crowned reverse.\n"
"Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.\n"
"Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.\n"
"She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.\n"
"Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.\n"
"And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.\n"
"“Nonsense, child! expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.\n"
"Will you explain why! retorted James, turtling also.\n"
"“And father has no money, I’m sure, said Alvina.\n"
"It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Witham’s part.\n"
"He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.\n"
"There was one who was climbing out, to be a gentleman.\n"
"The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.\n"
"“Are they for me? she said, with false brightness.\n"
"I believe he’s a despicable character, said James.\n"
"You ought not to want all your children to feel alike.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.\n"
"After this she really did what she could to avoid him.\n"
"“The bone isn’t broken, she said professionally.\n"
"Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.\n"
"But she could not sew—and she could not settle down.\n"
"But all the time, what was there actually in her life?\n"
"She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.\n"
"Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.\n"
"So again he walked down to Lumley to post his letters.\n"
"Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.\n"
"But James was in one of his abstractions, his trances.\n"
"He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.\n"
"And in a while she began to eat, as if she were alone.\n"
"Not another word about the cinema: not another breath.\n"
"As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.\n"
"Which is all I have to say, announced Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"After all, your father’s affairs don’t concern me.\n"
"But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.\n"
"“Goodness! she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"Physically he was not there: he was oddly an absentee.\n"
"The Endeavour was successful—yes, it was successful.\n"
"The four young men were four nice civil young fellows.\n"
"“I’ll go to bed, said Madame, obediently rising.\n"
"Ach, oh jeh, oh jeh!  “Ach nein, Madame, ach nein.\n"
"“Good-night, my faithful Max, I trust myself to you.\n"
"Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.\n"
"It is too dre-eadful, too dre-eadful! wailed Madame.\n"
"What does Madame _do_? she asked a little jealously.\n"
"But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.\n"
"He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.\n"
"Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.\n"
"They took off his waistcoat and pushed back his shirt.\n"
"“If the bone isn’t broken! said Louis anxiously.\n"
"Please!  “What? said Madame, eyeing her closely.\n"
"“Yes, he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.\n"
"She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.\n"
"She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.\n"
"“Oh yes! she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.\n"
"“But you can’t help it, away there from everybody.\n"
"It is all of it true, whispered Madame vindictively.\n"
"When he got into the hall he laid his hand on his hat.\n"
"“This is polite behaviour! she said sarcastically.\n"
"But I’ve been here many years, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"And she’s got no relations to go to either, has she?\n"
"Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.\n"
"But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.\n"
"I shall see. Till one and all became angry with her.\n"
"“At the station! exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.\n"
"It was my great-grandmother’s.  “Do you mean it?\n"
"Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.\n"
"After all, she had been bred up differently from that.\n"
"“I’ve had ham and eggs before.  “You do, hein?\n"
"She clung to Ciccio’s dark, despised foreign nature.\n"
"“We must have supper.  It was past nine o’clock.\n"
"Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.\n"
"Upon my word!  “I don’t think so, said Alvina.\n"
"“Good-morning! she said, and went on with her tea.\n"
"“But you can have love without marriage, she said.\n"
"She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.\n"
"There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.\n"
"She ought to take the twelve-forty train to Mansfield.\n"
"She knew she would be much cheaper in Madame’s eyes.\n"
"“You tell Atterwell what to put on father’s stone.\n"
"It must have been a detective—some shoddy detective.\n"
"She insisted on Miss Pinnegar’s having half of this.\n"
"Isn’t it so?  “Perhaps it is, admitted Alvina.\n"
"Gradually Dr. Mitchell’s manner changed towards her.\n"
"As they drove he saw a man with a barrow of cucumbers.\n"
"“I didn’t intend to disturb you, nurse, he said.\n"
"But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.\n"
"“I think to Windermere—into the Lakes, she said.\n"
"The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.\n"
"“I quite understand that, he replied deliberately.\n"
"Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!\n"
"When she was at the station she saw crowds and bustle.\n"
"“Don’t play a game with me, he said dangerously.\n"
"But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.\n"
"“Shall you come with me to Italy, Allaye?  “Yes.\n"
"So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.\n"
"A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.\n"
"There were quarries near the railway, and men working.\n"
"The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.\n"
"“Come in, and warm yourself, said the young woman.\n"
"It was freezing, the mountain high-road was congealed.\n"
"And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.\n"
"There was one cup, one enamelled mug, one little bowl.\n"
"It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.\n"
"She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.\n"
"But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.\n"
"She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.\n"
"“Would you?  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.\n"
"“How nice they are! said Alvina when she had left.\n"
"He was thin, and very shabby, and rather out of shape.\n"
"She only had his passive self, and his family passion.\n"
"She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.\n"
"He was a dandy with pale grey eyes and a heavy figure.\n"

"“Do you think I shall ever see you again? she said.\n"
"The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.\n"
"She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.\n"
"He will not trouble you.  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.\n"
"But if you have decided—  Neither of them answered.\n"
"“Miss Houghton herself must decide.  “Oh sure—!\n"
"It won’t be much, then?  “Really, I don’t know.\n"

"“Madame is going to drive to the station, she said.\n"
"“So, we go together in the cab, said Madame to him.\n"
"And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.\n"
"But she knew it was something improper, on her account.\n"
"Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.\n"
"And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.\n"
"Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.\n"
"He lifted his face to her, and shook his head slightly.\n"
"Why— he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate.\n"
"“How do you do? and she thrust out her hand to him.\n"
"I mean them.  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.\n"
"You need to be looked after.  “Do I, Miss Pinnegar!\n"
"Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.\n"
"Comment allez-vous, alors?  “Bien! said Geoffrey.\n"
"“But I might be afraid of a husband-bear, she said.\n"
"“Yes, they both slept in the end room, said Alvina.\n"
"I don’t think so.  “But even then, said Alvina.\n"
"When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.\n"
"“Give this letter to Madame, Alvina said to Ciccio.\n"
"Madame did not consider Alvina’s view very seriously.\n"
"And cucumbers are poison to everybody.  “_Cum-bers!\n"

"“We will sit here, as I do, to eat, said Pancrazio.\n"
"Pancrazio was very happy if Alvina would accompany him.\n"
"Pancrazio went in and out, back and forth from his pot.\n"
"In the distance, Ossona hung at the edge of a platform.\n"
"Let him go to the piazza or to the wine-shop, and talk.\n"

"During the night four or five inches of snow had fallen.\n"
"In a short time they had reached the minister’s house.\n"
"He handed them to Chester, who looked over them eagerly.\n"
"But, Mr. Tripp, I’ve come here on business.  “Hey?\n"
"It was paid for out of the minister’s charitable fund.\n"
"“How long were you in making the drawing? she asked.\n"
"He’s talkin’ of reducin’ me to two dollars a week.\n"
"“I supposed you’d stand up for him, sneered Silas.\n"
"“Where is my money, you villain? he demanded, hotly.\n"
"Have you ever thought of coming to New York to     live?\n"
"“And you bring it to me?  “Yes, it belongs to you.\n"
"He would keep the money himself, and conceal the record.\n"
"He, himself, had found it and kept it in his possession.\n"
"There was one thing, however, that Chester did not know.\n"
"He was playing with Mullins as a cat plays with a mouse.\n"
"He discharged Abel Wood soon after you went to New York.\n"
"“He’s a scamp! commented the man from Minneapolis.\n"
"“Are you going to the theater, Chester? asked Felix.\n"
"He was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us.\n"
"You had better go back, and Ralston prepared to go on.\n"
"I was in luck.  “Do you get six dollars?  “More.\n"
"“Isn’t he here now? demanded Silas, with surprise.\n"
"“It is a wonderful place, Chester, said Mr. Perkins.\n"
"A pickpocket took it while I was looking in at a window.\n"
"When Mr. Fairchild returned Felix delivered the message.\n"
"We don’t want to be at the tail end of the procession.\n"
"“Shan’t I see you again, Mr. Wilson? asked Edward.\n"
"It is two dollars more than I received at my last place.\n"
"She has     held out pretty firm, but she may yield yet.\n"
"I did not think to look.  “Your case is unfortunate.\n"
"Mullins, I haven’t the least intention of harming you.\n"
"“The next day my employer summoned me to his presence.\n"
"Perhaps all they lack is an occupation: in short, a job.\n"
"But the poor-spirited Woodhouse people were weak buyers.\n"
"The whole affair was ricketty, amateurish, and twopenny.\n"
"So she neither questioned nor accepted, but just let be.\n"
"At such times Miss Frost’s heart went cold within her.\n"
"Act just for yourself, dear—the rest doesn’t matter.\n"
"If it had she would certainly never have entertained it.\n"
"But she had serious confidential talks with Dr. Fordham.\n"
"She ground her teeth and screamed and yelled with pains.\n"
"So Alvina spun her medal, and her medal came down tails.\n"
"This was the end of another woman’s life: such an end!\n"
"Her mother’s little sitting-room was cold and disused.\n"
"It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master.\n"
"“But we don’t want father to go on with this scheme.\n"
"He seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element.\n"
"“No, I don’t know so much about that, said Albert.\n"
"But it has its attractions. Here he smiled meaningful.\n"
"Without a thought, she turned on her heel and fled away.\n"
"“Are you hurt? called Alvina, looking up into space.\n"
"“Which way? she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.\n"
"In the Withams’ pew sat Lottie and Albert—no Arthur.\n"
"“You never spoke to Mr. Witham? Miss Pinnegar asked.\n"
"Now he found himself more or less stranded in Woodhouse.\n"
"And he always walked down to Lumley to post his letters.\n"
"Once they had gone cold, they would never warm up again.\n"
"She hurried off to her bedroom to laugh and cry at once.\n"
"And swamped—_swamped_ with her dirty old carrot water.\n"
"I saw her at a friend’s when I came back from America.\n"
"She scorned to count “Welcome All. Mr. May said Yes.\n"
"But she marched down one of the pews, and took her seat.\n"
"But Miss Pinnegar was sadly hot and squeezed in her pew.\n"
"Sudden curtain, and a yell of ecstasy from the colliers.\n"
"Miss Poppy herself sets all store on her cup and saucer.\n"
"“How much have we taken, father? asked Alvina gaily.\n"
"“I’ve brought you the cough stuff, said the widow.\n"
"She had dropped the cigarette unnoticed into the hearth.\n"
"“But perhaps tomorrow.  “No, today, said Madame.\n"
"Alvina began to understand Madame’s subjection to him.\n"
"The bear drops Ciccio lifeless, and turns to Kishwégin.\n"
"“I should love to go.  He looked down into her eyes.\n"
"Why are you at all?  “Nonsensical? laughed Alvina.\n"
"“And what about yellow eyes? asked Alvina, laughing.\n"
"“May I hear it too?  “Oh, said Madame, drawling.\n"
"“Comment? queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.\n"
"And how?—and where?—in this country?—tell me that.\n"
"Is he quite obstinate?  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.\n"
"Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.\n"
"Finish this week and then go, go—But finish this week.\n"
"“Do come! she urged, never taking her eyes from him.\n"
"“Won’t you come? She smiled strangely and vividly.\n"
"Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.\n"
"True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.\n"
"“I should like awfully— a flush grew on her cheek.\n"
"Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.\n"
"The doctor came—she went to the registrar—and so on.\n"
"But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.\n"
"He went ducking along the dark yard, nearly to the gate.\n"
"“On ne fume pas dans le salon, said Madame brutally.\n"
"Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.\n"
"“What about the theatre?—will it go on? she asked.\n"
"I don’t know, she doesn’t seem to hook on, does she?\n"
"She’d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.\n"
"“I couldn’t keep away from you, Madame, she cried.\n"
"You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.\n"
"“Yet he promised.  Again Madame smiled sardonically.\n"
"“See, my dear, that your money is safe, said Madame.\n"
"“What a good brooch, eh? Madame fingered the brooch.\n"
"Madame sat at one end of the table, Alvina at the other.\n"
"There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.\n"
"“Pacohuila! cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.\n"
"When she came to her door, she turned and looked at him.\n"
"A’ open ’eart ’s worth all your bum-righteousness.\n"
"“You can have that if you like, Madame, said Alvina.\n"
"And the next day the same, she was all icy pleasantness.\n"
"The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.\n"
"And instinct told her that he might ignore her for ever.\n"
"But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.\n"
"“The best! He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.\n"
"And your father a month dead.  “It doesn’t matter.\n"
"“How not like it!  “I don’t like it, she said.\n"
"He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.\n"
"Don’t you all?  The two other men smiled and nodded.\n"
"Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.\n"
"It’s almost _White Slave Traffic_, on Madame’s part.\n"
"“I love thee, I love thee as a brother, and also more.\n"
"She didn’t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.\n"
"I wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation.\n"
"Alvina did _not_ want to go to Mansfield that afternoon.\n"
"But their hearts hardened with black, indomitable anger.\n"
"But Alvina felt herself particularly excluded, left out.\n"
"Then she wired home to her doctor for another reference.\n"
"She went rapidly from case to case, as she was summoned.\n"
"“Why I do ten times the work that any one of you does.\n"
"came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina.\n"
"But I think I’m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.\n"
"They went downstairs, and Alvina returned to her duties.\n"
"“The pains have begun, said Alvina, hurrying to her.\n"
"But the doctor had replied that Nurse would ring him up.\n"
"She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster.\n"
"“Of course!—another of Mrs. Tuke’s exclamations.\n"
"He came to her, smiling softly, to take her in his arms.\n"
"England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging.\n"
"Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions.\n"
"“I think it’s lovely—wonderful, she said, dazed.\n"
"Err! cried Pancrazio, striking the beast on the flank.\n"
"Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water.\n"
"Alvina came out of the icy bedroom to the black kitchen.\n"
"Then she scrubbed the two little tables and the shelves.\n"
"His yellow, luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her.\n"
"Beautiful, in our musical sense of the word, it was not.\n"

"It was already ten o’clock when she hurried downstairs.\n"
"Then he’d believe in you.  But Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"“Does it mean we owe seven hundred pounds? she asked.\n"

"You had better get intimate with him and offer him cigarettes.\n"
"Obviously the receipt belonged to James Long, who had lost it.\n"
"“I guess you are used to babies, said the mother, pleased.\n"
"“I would, but I am to meet a friend uptown at six o’clock.\n"
"Though well convinced of it, he wished to find out positively.\n"
"I should have seen them if he left them here.  “All right.\n"
"He has tried two boys since, but doesn’t seem to get suited.\n"
"But how did he happen to call on you?  “There you have me.\n"

"“Oh well, if she _does_— said Miss Pinnegar cryptically.\n"
"They pinched her haunches and attacked her in unheard-of ways.\n"
"She was beaten by fate, as far as chastity and virginity went.\n"
"And in her civilian clothes she seemed a little dowdy, shabby.\n"
"Why, in the name of all the free heavens, have human criteria?\n"
"“I can’t see what it is to laugh at, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"

"This was the Withams’ new house, and Lottie was proud of it.\n"
"_Still_, she was rather impressed by the sense of superiority.\n"

"These were his children—most curious chips of the old block.\n"
"She liked taking a walk, in her lingering indifferent fashion.\n"
"“It would do you good to get a bit of exercise out of doors.\n"
"He mounted the steps, still holding his bunch of white stocks.\n"
"He remained standing in the porch, staring at the closed door.\n"
"“Well, said Miss Pinnegar decidedly, as Alvina re-entered.\n"
"He annoyed her a little, by being completely oblivious of her.\n"
"And she, obedient, began to tie the bandage with numb fingers.\n"
"She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him.\n"
"“And is there need to understand the other?  “Certainly.\n"
"He would accept the ten pounds; but he would get his own back.\n"

"They wanted to examine my private morals, for eugenic reasons.\n"
"“I hope you’ll go further than _thinking_, said Mr. May.\n"
"He sorted them in heaps, and marked the heaps in his own mind.\n"
"“How did it go?  “I think it went very well, she said.\n"
"I know they like them once they’re there, and they see them.\n"
"I can dance today.  “I don’t think today, said Alvina.\n"
"“You won’t have to dance, said Geoffrey out of the bear.\n"
"I am practical impractically— she stumbled over the words.\n"
"Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.\n"
"But perhaps to you it is kind.  “Thank you, said Alvina.\n"
"There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.\n"
"“Geoffrey ought to know, said Madame, looking at Geoffrey.\n"
"His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.\n"
"She heard Miss Pinnegar’s scarcely audible step approaching.\n"
"I wouldn’t think of it. He turtled like an injured pigeon.\n"
"“What makes you feel so sure about it?  “I don’t know.\n"
"He looked up, with a faint smile, from under his black lashes.\n"

"Ay, she was a lot more of a mother to her than her own mother.\n"
"“And if there is nothing, what do you intend? said Madame.\n"
"Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.\n"
"But a hundred and twenty is better than a blow to the eye, eh?\n"
"“Old paste—old paste—antique—  “No, said Alvina.\n"
"Then she looked into Alvina’s eyes, really a little jealous.\n"
"“L’allée italienne! he said, and shouted with laughter.\n"
"Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.\n"
"Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.\n"
"Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.\n"
"So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.\n"
"And he seemed to throw her down and suffocate her like a wave.\n"
"It was not a warm morning, but there was a streak of sunshine.\n"
"Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.  “Don’t say so!\n"
"Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.\n"
"“And where are the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras this week? he asked.\n"
"She turned off the gas at the meter, and went upstairs to bed.\n"
"She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.\n"
"When she could lie still she turned away from him, still mute.\n"
"“I am staying with friends, here and there, for a few weeks.\n"
"“I’m afraid there is nothing very pleasant, unfortunately.\n"
"In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.\n"
"I must go this afternoon.  “On account of your engagement?\n"
"You know I mean what I say, Mrs. Larrick—this to the wife.\n"

"He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.\n"
"“Oh, it will be over in six weeks, said the doctor easily.\n"

"Nurse!— came the long call of Mrs. Tuke through the night.\n"
"Then she shuddered, and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief.\n"
"Do let me see him.  “Do you really want to? said Alvina.\n"
"Ciccio shifted on his feet, watching Alvina pour out the port.\n"
"He turned immediately, with his cap in his hand, and followed.\n"
"“If you have to be torn to pieces by forces, well, you have.\n"
"However, her month’s notice was up, so she was legally free.\n"
"He pointed to the harbour clock—it was ten minutes past ten.\n"
"It was strange to feel the seethe of war and dread in the air.\n"
"She half pitied Alvina, and was more than half jealous of her.\n"
"So she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin.\n"
"“I couldn’t get a cart to come down, he said in English.\n"
"“They are doing some washing, said Pancrazio, explanatory.\n"

"Ciccio would have to take her to England again, or to America.\n"
"They were all talking, in the bright clear air of the morning.\n"
