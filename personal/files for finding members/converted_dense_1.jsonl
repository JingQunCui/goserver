"And is it possible you can be ty’d up to a Wife?\n"
"Pleasant this--Well, _Frank_, I do--And what then?\n"
"I say, let me no more see thee approach this Lady.\n"
"--But pray, how long, Sir, have you lov’d me so?\n"
"Come, give me your Vows, or we must part for ever.\n"
"Why, Sir--what think you of debauching his Sister?\n"
"And you, _Frank_, will you marry my Niece _Diana_?\n"
"Well, and what do you intend to do, if it be, Sir?\n"
"_Enter_ Bellmour, _Sir_ Timothy, Sham _and_ Sharp.\n"
"Come hither, _Frank_, is not this a fine Creature?\n"
"--Nay, now--nor Heaven, nor Hell, shall hinder me.\n"
"Sir, my Lord Plotwell is at the Door in his Coach.\n"
"Rise, and whate’er you ask, I’ll freely grant.\n"
"To wait my Doom; what Tidings hast thou, _Guzman_?\n"
"he may be the Devil’s Fellow by his countenance.\n"
"Hah, ‘tis the Sot himself;--my name is _Carlos_.\n"
"What means he, sure he has a Gad-bee in his Brain.\n"
"I know thou wilt be true, and I’ll not doubt it.\n"
"Hey, Rogues, Rascals, Boys, follow me just behind.\n"
"Ah, nothing but a great gilt Coach will become it.\n"
"Oh, nothing is so ventrous as Love, if it be true.\n"
"Why, ‘tis the great _Turk_, a Queen of _Turkey_.\n"
"I’ll see no more,--here I have fix’d my heart.\n"
"--Attend these Captives, at a respectful distance.\n"
"not I, why, what hurt is there in being a Cuckold?\n"
"You need not tell us, we have been witness to all.\n"
"By Heav’n, each Moment makes me more your Slave.\n"
"Answer me first, what makes you here this Morning?\n"
"Away with it, to the Bride’s _Haunce in Kelder_.\n"
"Pray, Sir, what store of Miracles have you at _St.\n"
"For sure thou canst not take a Shape to fright me.\n"
"--Take to thee Courage, and behold thy Slaughters.\n"
"--Hah--hum--what’s here--                 _Bel_.\n"
"Oh, Sir, you’re welcome from _Northamptonshire_.\n"
"Hah--who’s that knocks--who’s there?--  _Bel_.\n"
"I wou’d fain ask--a civil Question or two first.\n"
"Well, Sir, do you not know that I am married, Sir?\n"
"Hah--I hope ‘tis no stol’n Goods;    [_Aside_.\n"
"Believe me, that Dissembling was his Master-piece.\n"
"Why should he fear, did not my Father promise him?\n"
"It may be so--but she shall do’t discretly then.\n"
"I am dead, I’m dead; will no Repentence save me?\n"
"What, in love with any body, but your own Husband?\n"
"Away, be gone--I’ll never see you more--  _Gay_.\n"
"None--’twas filthy Avarice seduc’d him to’t.\n"
"She is also courted by the cowardly fop, Falatius.\n"
"By _Jove_, he’s dissatisfy’d with every thing.\n"
"He’s damn’d will lose a moment on’t for you.\n"
"What meanest thou, is she not married?--  _Alcan_.\n"
"Oh, tell me not of kindness, where’s _Alcippus_?\n"
"‘Tis much, my Lord, you’ll not be satisfy’d.\n"
"Nay, why shouldst thou delay me thus with stories?\n"
"Thou hast amaz’d me, prithee speak more clearly.\n"
"_Re-enter_ Falatius, _with_ Alcander _melancholy_.\n"
"By Jove, there is no truth in them, that’s flat.\n"
"Nay, now y’are too unjust, and I will leave you.\n"
"Thou know’st thy power, and now or never use it.\n"
"My Lord the Prince, what makes your Highness here?\n"
"--Where dost thou mean, bad Man, to hide thy head?\n"
"Why, Sir, do you think there can indeed be Ghosts?\n"
"--Sure I am fixt, what, shall the Devil fright me?\n"
"Well, Sir, your business, for mine requires haste.\n"

"“I ain’t rich, said Silas Tripp, cautiously.\n"
"“Yes, I had to part with my overcoat long since.\n"
"Silas Tripp has a small soul, hardly worth saving.\n"
"“I want everything to be legal, resumed Bruce.\n"
"If you     have any others ready, send them along.\n"
"“You’ve got a tidy little place here, ma’am.\n"
"“I wonder where he’s going, thought Chester.\n"
"Don’t you go for to run away.  Chester smiled.\n"
"“I say, there’s the tramp now, he exclaimed.\n"
"“Does Mr. James Long live here? asked Chester.\n"
"He says that he left it behind in the office here.\n"
"“I think I’ll go to Daly’s Theater to-night.\n"
"He was shown at once into the professor’s study.\n"
"“May I come in, uncle? he asked, with a smile.\n"
"Would you like to see him?  Chester shrank back.\n"
"“Did you come to see me? asked Ernest, softly.\n"
"But his heart was filled with feverish excitement.\n"
"“Who are you? asked the astonished bookkeeper.\n"
"“Yes, he answered, “he arrived last evening.\n"
"“I bring you an invitation to dinner, he said.\n"
"“Only a rich boy, corrected Chester, laughing.\n"
"“Am I to arrest this man? asked the policeman.\n"
"“There’s a great row at the office, he said.\n"
"On Fourteenth Street he fell in with Felix Gordon.\n"
"Then ask a fair price, not one that is exorbitant.\n"
"Will you go over with me to Mr. Taylor’s office?\n"
"“Good-evening, Mr. Mullins, he said, politely.\n"
"He had not been aware that his stepson could swim.\n"
"A terrible surprise was in store for Mrs. Trimble.\n"
"“Good-evenin’, widder, said Silas, coughing.\n"
"Such it was in the last calm year of plenty, 1913.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar served in the shop on Friday nights.\n"
"In Manchester House, every voice lowered its tone.\n"
"She was not particularly religious by inclination.\n"
"It was his teeth which Miss Frost could not stand.\n"
"She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive.\n"
"But out of a certain perversity, she wanted to go.\n"
"Well, a pretty lot they were, one way and another.\n"
"Miss Frost shuddered, and abstained from question.\n"
"Headley in particular hoped he might overcome her.\n"
"Was it worth much, after all, behaving as she did?\n"
"So both alike were defeated in their expectations.\n"
"For her wonderful energy had ebbed and oozed away.\n"
"Alvina said nothing, but settled down to her task.\n"
"There was no spontaneous interchange between them.\n"
"We all know what a provincial Temperance Hotel is.\n"
"It all seemed really too funny to her—too funny.\n"
"What’s that for? asked Lottie Witham shrewdly.\n"
"But she liked Arthur Witham, in his shirt sleeves.\n"
"But it was Arthur who came out into communication.\n"
"“You won’t _say_ you are, interposed Arthur.\n"
"He did not seem to be walking with his whole body.\n"
"There isn’t more than a minute’s fixing to do.\n"
"“It’ll wash out, he said, frightened of her.\n"
"“I must go home.  “Why, what’s your hurry!\n"
"Emphatically, she did not want to work for a wage.\n"
"And this is humiliating, the ultimate humiliation.\n"
"I’m afraid he will have to do that part himself.\n"
"“Mushrooms—most beautiful things in the world.\n"
"The crowd quieted itself, the eloquence flowed on.\n"
"The crowd was sick of James, and began to shuffle.\n"
"For she did not find him at all physically moving.\n"
"Although you smile.  Alvina did more than smile.\n"
"I know they always talk as if we were second-rate.\n"
"And she became somewhat vulgarized in her bearing.\n"
"Alvina went across to Madame with the thermometer.\n"
"“I don’t think you can see at all, she said.\n"
"There, Miss Houghton, I shall do what you tell me.\n"
"All alike! Madame subsided fretfully and weakly.\n"
"The men rise once more and bend over the prisoner.\n"
"But Mr. May was a little too frisky as Kishwégin.\n"
"And now they think they’ve done it all, you see.\n"
"A tidy man, _I_ say.  He did not look at Alvina.\n"
"You know they’re only men dressed up, for money.\n"
"Of course you wouldn’t be a good business woman.\n"
"Mr. May enjoyed himself hugely playing Kishwégin.\n"
"“Let us see.  Max now moved his arm with pain.\n"
"Alvina stole out of the room, followed by Mr. May.\n"
"Ciccio! he yelled, dropping off his own bicycle.\n"
"Wants thee to come back.  Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"Come with me, because I haven’t all my strength.\n"
"“Te voilà donc! she said, without expression.\n"
"“Sure, he said slowly, with subtle intonation.\n"
"And I don’t want to rob Natcha-Kee-Tawara, do I?\n"
"She did not know what to say, and he said nothing.\n"
"He had developed a nervous horror of all artistes.\n"
"She looked back at him, as from across a distance.\n"
"And I warrant they’ll want to be at the funeral.\n"
"But all the time she was uttering her condolences.\n"
"Nor do they know the Swiss clean and proper house.\n"
"He felt himself imprisoned and out of his element.\n"
"Ay, if she had her rights she’d be a rich woman.\n"
"Ay, when she thinks she’s hooked on to somebody.\n"
"She tried to think of Madame’s slow enunciation.\n"
"“All right, he said, shaking her hand loosely.\n"
"“All right, he said, ducking and turning away.\n"
"Chianti—hein?  They all bowed above the table.\n"
"It was the unknown beauty which almost killed her.\n"
"“I shall go and look at the town, said Alvina.\n"
"“You will come with me to Woodhouse? she said.\n"
"Come on bicycle with me.  Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"There were other people in the carriage with them.\n"
"She wished, for the moment, Ciccio were not there.\n"
"Why even Miss Pinnegar would be lost if she could.\n"
"What a blow you give me!  “Why? said Alvina.\n"
"“Oh! perked Mr. May, yellow with strange rage.\n"
"“Now.  For a second, she struggled frenziedly.\n"
"For answer, she only looked at him with wide eyes.\n"
"She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready.\n"
"“It’s not more than I expected, said Alvina.\n"
"Why, Miss Frost earned a good deal more than I do.\n"
"“Let us wait, and see.  She took it smilingly.\n"
"So Alvina knew that she was not very badly wanted.\n"
"And if not?  The two women looked at each other.\n"
"Ciccio turned aside, with his faint, stupid smile.\n"
"The medical board were charming to her—charming.\n"
"She could begin tomorrow—but she had no uniform.\n"
"Certainly she neither feared nor even admired him.\n"
"And the next time I ask you, you’ll let me know.\n"
"But there were plenty of worse hurts in the world.\n"
"Perfectly horrible!  “Well, said the matron.\n"
"They threw aside the whole vestment of convention.\n"
"Then in the drive she picked up Effie’s flowers.\n"
"I can understand a little Italian— She paused.\n"
"Oh—! She was wild and sweating with her pains.\n"
"But _ultimately_ she could find no fault with him.\n"
"He was very happy, and his face had a real beauty.\n"
"Never had she felt so utterly strange and far-off.\n"
"Piace?  “Do you like it, interpreted Ciccio.\n"
"Of course, I knew molto, from, music, she added.\n"
"“Have you brought food?  “No, said Ciccio.\n"
"But there—a clocking, shouting, splashing sound.\n"
"And it seemed as if they needed some one to serve.\n"
"This coarse, heavy food was wearying beyond words.\n"
"Ciccio persuaded Alvina to stay in bed a few days.\n"
"I shall go to England.  He watched her narrowly.\n"
"“What is it? she said, laying her hand on him.\n"
"“I can’t come back. She heard it so fatally.\n"
"She blew out the light, that she need not see him.\n"

"“I don’t think I care much for life, he said.\n"
"You found the whisky here.  Ramsay made no reply.\n"

"“I will go up to Mr. Conrad’s room, said Rob.\n"
"“Now, he said, “I had better do the ordering.\n"

"It was not often that Silas Tripp went to New York.\n"
"He saw that the bait was likely to prove effective.\n"
"“Oh, you mean the real estate office, she said.\n"

"“Thank you, said Alvina, and the girl departed.\n"
"What ought James Houghton to have done differently?\n"
"He would never be a gentleman if he lived for ever.\n"
"Wherever he was, his wife was a hundred miles away.\n"
"Getting on all right?  “Fair, said the woman.\n"
"When would he be able to get an advance from James?\n"
"I couldn’t think of it.  “Then name a figure.\n"
"He wrote various letters and drew up certain notes.\n"
"The shop isn’t worth while, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"It’s a mercy Miss Frost and your mother are dead.\n"
"He was terribly secretive with respect to business.\n"
"I know we are.  Mr. May looked down in the mouth.\n"
"You couldn’t get excited about it: not as a rule.\n"
"The trams, moreover, would begin to run in January.\n"
"“These are my family of young men, said Madame.\n"
"Que ferez-vous, mes pauvres, sans votre Kishwégin.\n"
"Alvina hurried indoors, and the young man followed.\n"
"What a white-skinned, soft, plump child she seemed!\n"
"Alvina practised the music Madame carried with her.\n"
"“Yes, you’re wonderful, said Alvina, choking.\n"
"Yet she felt convinced of his ultimate good-nature.\n"
"Helpless, inert she lay, in her orgasm of laughter.\n"
"The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras all sat with straight faces.\n"
"Then what future have you? said Mr. May gloomily.\n"
"Ah, this Woodhouse, a curse is on it, I know it is.\n"
"Then he mounted and rode in the opposite direction.\n"
"You must never let them think you have caught them.\n"
"Still she smiled at him, and still he gave no sign.\n"
"But she could not make out what his watching meant.\n"
"He was a little bit repellent and brutal, inverted.\n"
"She loved them so much, she wanted to be with them.\n"
"He could not interrupt Alvina, nor the performance.\n"
"“Father, she said, shaking his shoulder gently.\n"
"“Can you manage? cried Alvina, showing a light.\n"
"Mr. May came in, and stayed for a dismal half-hour.\n"
"“I should like him to come, said Alvina simply.\n"
"And if he will still have you, then you must think.\n"
"“You return to the funeral? said Madame coldly.\n"
"“Buy Miss Houghton out— said Madame shrewdly.\n"
"He was bad enough enemy to his own flesh and blood.\n"
"Everything he’s got’s mortgaged up to the hilt.\n"
"Alvina broke away from her cousin, and went to him.\n"
"“Tell me what _you_ think, she said repeatedly.\n"
"Madame looked up, almost annoyed, when she entered.\n"
"“And how is everything at Woodhouse? she asked.\n"
"And after all, Woodhouse wasn’t fifty miles away.\n"
"The young men had been out shopping for the supper.\n"
"Yes? she added, with her subtle, malicious smile.\n"
"“Please don’t get up, she said to the others.\n"
"“I don’t want to stay here, anyhow, she said.\n"
"Pas pour moi!  And they went laughing downstairs.\n"
"But I’m afraid we shall have a rather _dry_ game?\n"
"“I shall sell out of the Endeavour.  “Really!\n"
"“And have you told Miss Pinnegar? said Mr. May.\n"
"Alvina looked at Ciccio, who stood above, watching.\n"
"And quickly she prepared breakfast and made a fire.\n"
"You might come to the lawyer’s with me, will you?\n"
"“You’ll be there at seven o’clock? he said.\n"
"“But you’re all right, yourself, Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"It’s all shown in my books, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"The cordiality, the _joie de vivre_ did not revive.\n"
"“To look at the papers and magazines.  “Ha-a!\n"
"Every one is most kind, and I feel at home already.\n"
"“Fower per cent., mimicked the doctor brutally.\n"
"And I know that those things cause me half my work.\n"
"“Oh yes, I intend to, he said, with confidence.\n"
"But wondering about the Natchas would not help her.\n"
"She knew that she would put off Dr. Mitchell again.\n"
"His face was blind with anger, like a hot, red sun.\n"
"And both of us, since we are now one, he replied.\n"
"Next month, at the latest.  “Oh no, she said.\n"
"“My flesh isn’t concerned, and my mind isn’t.\n"
"“Oh, the flesh is a _beastly_ thing! she cried.\n"
"But she found Ciccio leaning against a gate-pillar.\n"
"It’s horrible—  “Well, it’s not my fault.\n"
"Come with me, Allaye.  She could not look at him.\n"
"She was not in the village of Pescocalascio itself.\n"
"But her chest was raw, she felt weak and miserable.\n"
"Ciccio too was feasted, in the dark hole of a room.\n"
"The old crone said something unintelligible to her.\n"
"Don’t wait for me! he cried, his voice muffled.\n"

"Mullins—been in this office?  “About five years.\n"
"A piece of paper on the floor attracted his attention.\n"
"“You did not forget your appointment.  “No, sir.\n"
"“That is my poor, little cousin, explained Arthur.\n"
"He seemed to fall in love with Chester at first sight.\n"
"Well, I thought as you did, that it was of little use.\n"
"If Dick Ralston and others could be lucky, why not he?\n"
"There were reasons why the gambler decided to go slow.\n"
"Mullins sat on a stool at the desk, picking his teeth.\n"
"Then a customer came in, who had to receive attention.\n"
"He saw that Felix thought him to be out of employment.\n"
"“Assuredly, my dear sir, said Gripp, with suavity.\n"
"Felix Gordon was just leaving the office on an errand.\n"
"“Is that Mr. Fairchild’s office? inquired Silas.\n"
"“Was this package given you at the bank? he asked.\n"
"I got only five dollars a week, and my room costs two.\n"
"“Don’t you remember me, Mr. Wilson? said Edward.\n"
"“Will your son be able to pay this? asked Chester.\n"
"“I had a few dollars saved, and went to Minneapolis.\n"
"He was in a very awkward position, and he realized it.\n"
"But like a butterfly James fluttered over his fabrics.\n"
"A few Fridays later he came out with his Winter Touch.\n"
"Ten villages stared and crushed round the plate glass.\n"
"Again the good dame was thoroughly lower middle-class.\n"
"James hovered round and said the last word, of course.\n"
"He trembled in all his limbs, at the touch of success.\n"
"He bought her a ring, an emerald set in tiny diamonds.\n"
"The food was objectionable—yet Alvina got fat on it.\n"
"It is but one side of the medal—the crowned reverse.\n"
"Now Alvina decided to accept the decision of her fate.\n"
"Alvina threw herself down on the seat of her carriage.\n"
"She had never to be off her guard for a single minute.\n"
"Our wives pine because we are virtuous but inadequate.\n"
"And Manchester House saw little of her, comparatively.\n"
"“Nonsense, child! expostulated Mrs. Lawson gently.\n"
"Will you explain why! retorted James, turtling also.\n"
"“And father has no money, I’m sure, said Alvina.\n"
"It was a rare and bold stroke on Mrs. Witham’s part.\n"
"He never conceived any connection with her whatsoever.\n"
"The poor thing was all the time swimming for her life.\n"
"“Are they for me? she said, with false brightness.\n"
"I believe he’s a despicable character, said James.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar eyed him with approval when she came in.\n"
"“The bone isn’t broken, she said professionally.\n"
"Then of her own kerchief she made a pad for the wound.\n"
"But all the time, what was there actually in her life?\n"
"She worked herself into quite a fever of anticipation.\n"
"Now so far, the story of Alvina is commonplace enough.\n"
"Whilst Mr. May abstractedly fingered his black knight.\n"
"He looked up bewildered, as one startled out of sleep.\n"
"As soon as James had eaten his plum tart, he ran away.\n"
"Which is all I have to say, announced Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"After all, your father’s affairs don’t concern me.\n"
"But the audience, vulgar as ever, cannot quite see it.\n"
"“Goodness! she cried, handing it to Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"“I’ll go to bed, said Madame, obediently rising.\n"
"“Good-night, my faithful Max, I trust myself to you.\n"
"Come, they are not good for you, the people, I see it.\n"
"What does Madame _do_? she asked a little jealously.\n"
"But certainly he was stupid, in her sense of the word.\n"
"He was extraordinarily velvety and alive on horseback.\n"
"Mr. May glanced quickly round, and advanced to Madame.\n"
"“If the bone isn’t broken! said Louis anxiously.\n"
"Please!  “What? said Madame, eyeing her closely.\n"
"“Yes, he re-echoed, almost mocking in his triumph.\n"
"She answered their questions simply, but did not talk.\n"
"She did not know where it came from, she felt so cold.\n"
"“Oh yes! she whispered, with a contemptuous mouth.\n"
"“But you can’t help it, away there from everybody.\n"
"It is all of it true, whispered Madame vindictively.\n"
"“This is polite behaviour! she said sarcastically.\n"
"But I’ve been here many years, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"Poor Miss Pinnegar, that was all life had offered her.\n"
"But she supposed Italian words were a good deal alike.\n"
"I shall see. Till one and all became angry with her.\n"
"“At the station! exclaimed Madame, smiling grimly.\n"
"It was my great-grandmother’s.  “Do you mean it?\n"
"Alvina smiled a little wanly, wondering where she was.\n"
"After all, she had been bred up differently from that.\n"
"“I’ve had ham and eggs before.  “You do, hein?\n"
"She clung to Ciccio’s dark, despised foreign nature.\n"
"“We must have supper.  It was past nine o’clock.\n"
"Ciccio and Geoffrey watched him with dark-seeing eyes.\n"
"Upon my word!  “I don’t think so, said Alvina.\n"
"“Good-morning! she said, and went on with her tea.\n"
"“But you can have love without marriage, she said.\n"
"She fought against her own desire to fall at his feet.\n"
"There, across a little hollow, rose the cemetery hill.\n"
"She knew she would be much cheaper in Madame’s eyes.\n"
"“You tell Atterwell what to put on father’s stone.\n"
"It must have been a detective—some shoddy detective.\n"
"She insisted on Miss Pinnegar’s having half of this.\n"
"Gradually Dr. Mitchell’s manner changed towards her.\n"
"“I didn’t intend to disturb you, nurse, he said.\n"
"But habit, so far, prevented his doing more than beam.\n"
"“I think to Windermere—into the Lakes, she said.\n"
"The doctor dragged her up even to the slanting attics.\n"
"“I quite understand that, he replied deliberately.\n"
"Fancy reposing against his broad, navy blue waistcoat!\n"
"“Don’t play a game with me, he said dangerously.\n"
"But do take him the roses, and see what he looks like.\n"
"“Shall you come with me to Italy, Allaye?  “Yes.\n"
"So Alvina sat on the cliffs in a mood of exasperation.\n"
"A faint smile, very beautiful to her, was on his face.\n"
"There were quarries near the railway, and men working.\n"
"The road wound and swirled, trying to get up the pass.\n"
"“Come in, and warm yourself, said the young woman.\n"
"And then softly he blew a red-hot fire for the coffee.\n"
"It shocked her almost as if she had fallen into water.\n"
"She shuddered, and became semi-conscious with fatigue.\n"
"But fowls, geese, and the ass had made an end of this.\n"
"She could not sit in her bedroom, for it was too cold.\n"
"“Would you?  He slowly shook his head: indefinite.\n"
"“How nice they are! said Alvina when she had left.\n"
"She took a handful of the sappy, shut, striped flames.\n"
"The essence of poetry he ignores or takes for granted.\n"
"Swear by the ashes of your father, which lie unburied.\n"

"Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Alvina did not like her.\n"
"In Vina it came out in mad bursts of hilarious jeering.\n"
"Over Alexander’s letter Miss Frost shed bitter tears.\n"
"It seemed such a repulsive and indelicate step to take.\n"
"There was a great bustle, preparing her nursing outfit.\n"

"It cost a great struggle to be hard and callous enough.\n"

"“Good morning, Mr. Witham, replied Alvina brightly.\n"
"She felt as if she were really venturing on new ground.\n"
"Arthur lingered in the doorway a while, then went away.\n"
"Look here— And he began to pull up his trouser leg.\n"
"But Alvina had given the candle to Calladine, and fled.\n"
"For months, the thought of Albert was a torment to her.\n"
"“We never can understand those things, said Alvina.\n"
"I can see nothing wrong with him, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"Yet it was always packed with colliers and work-lasses.\n"
"He had decided he must make a percentage in other ways.\n"
"Alvina took up her fork and began to eat automatically.\n"
"It nearly killed James to take the prices they offered.\n"
"Madame and the four young men had arrived at about six.\n"
"It’s his business to go.  “Oh! returned Alvina.\n"
"“I’m afraid your cold is rather bad, said Alvina.\n"
"“Manca il cuore solamente al Ciccio, moaned Madame.\n"
"Afterwards he was to carry up the horse-hair arm-chair.\n"
"My poor _braves_, what will they do without Kishwégin?\n"
"The two tall Swiss looked down on him, faintly smiling.\n"
"He glanced round at Alvina, then went on with his work.\n"
"“We like her—we love her—as if she were a mother.\n"
"From the head I am business-woman, good business-woman.\n"
"“Alors! said Madame, cutting through this futility.\n"
"“Dost thou want to go with him? she asked suddenly.\n"
"Tell him that.  Geoffrey turned again into the house.\n"
"He looked at her sideways, furtively, but persistently.\n"
"And then her stealthy sympathy with the white prisoner!\n"
"But I won’t stay a minute.  “Oh, it is all right.\n"
"“You get dressed, Ciccio.  Ciccio looked at Alvina.\n"
"The rehearsal on the Monday morning bored her terribly.\n"
"She was just in time to open the door as Ciccio tapped.\n"
"He will not trouble you.  Ciccio looked up at Alvina.\n"
"But if you have decided—  Neither of them answered.\n"
"“Miss Houghton herself must decide.  “Oh sure—!\n"
"It won’t be much, then?  “Really, I don’t know.\n"
"Can you remember she went with Albert Witham for a bit.\n"
"“So, we go together in the cab, said Madame to him.\n"
"And in her dress she pinned a valuable old ruby brooch.\n"
"But she knew it was something improper, on her account.\n"
"Yet all the time, his lustrous dark beauty, unbearable.\n"
"And hence the Tawaras saved less money than they might.\n"
"Even Madame was a little afraid of Alvina this evening.\n"
"Why— he rolled his eyes and proceeded to calculate.\n"
"“How do you do? and she thrust out her hand to him.\n"
"I mean them.  Miss Pinnegar stood blank and helpless.\n"
"You need to be looked after.  “Do I, Miss Pinnegar!\n"
"Look, my boy, love needs no havings, but marriage does.\n"
"Comment allez-vous, alors?  “Bien! said Geoffrey.\n"
"“But I might be afraid of a husband-bear, she said.\n"
"“Yes, they both slept in the end room, said Alvina.\n"
"I don’t think so.  “But even then, said Alvina.\n"
"When Alvina came down, she returned to the living room.\n"
"Madame did not consider Alvina’s view very seriously.\n"

"He’s talkin’ of reducin’ me to two dollars a week.\n"
"“I supposed you’d stand up for him, sneered Silas.\n"
"“Where is my money, you villain? he demanded, hotly.\n"
"There was one thing, however, that Chester did not know.\n"
"He discharged Abel Wood soon after you went to New York.\n"
"“He’s a scamp! commented the man from Minneapolis.\n"
"“Are you going to the theater, Chester? asked Felix.\n"
"He was probably sent here by his uncle as a spy upon us.\n"
"I was in luck.  “Do you get six dollars?  “More.\n"
"“Isn’t he here now? demanded Silas, with surprise.\n"
"“It is a wonderful place, Chester, said Mr. Perkins.\n"

"Mullins, I haven’t the least intention of harming you.\n"
"“The next day my employer summoned me to his presence.\n"
"Perhaps all they lack is an occupation: in short, a job.\n"
"But the poor-spirited Woodhouse people were weak buyers.\n"
"The whole affair was ricketty, amateurish, and twopenny.\n"
"So she neither questioned nor accepted, but just let be.\n"
"At such times Miss Frost’s heart went cold within her.\n"
"Act just for yourself, dear—the rest doesn’t matter.\n"
"If it had she would certainly never have entertained it.\n"

"This was the end of another woman’s life: such an end!\n"
"Her mother’s little sitting-room was cold and disused.\n"
"It would be simply disastrous, because it had no master.\n"
"“But we don’t want father to go on with this scheme.\n"
"He seemed to swim like a fish in his own little element.\n"
"“No, I don’t know so much about that, said Albert.\n"
"But it has its attractions. Here he smiled meaningful.\n"
"Without a thought, she turned on her heel and fled away.\n"
"“Are you hurt? called Alvina, looking up into space.\n"
"“Which way? she asked, demurely, but a little sharp.\n"
"In the Withams’ pew sat Lottie and Albert—no Arthur.\n"
"“You never spoke to Mr. Witham? Miss Pinnegar asked.\n"
"Now he found himself more or less stranded in Woodhouse.\n"

"“May I hear it too?  “Oh, said Madame, drawling.\n"
"“Comment? queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.\n"
"And how?—and where?—in this country?—tell me that.\n"
"Is he quite obstinate?  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.\n"
"Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.\n"
"“Do come! she urged, never taking her eyes from him.\n"
"“Won’t you come? She smiled strangely and vividly.\n"
"Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.\n"
"True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.\n"
"“I should like awfully— a flush grew on her cheek.\n"
"Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.\n"
"The doctor came—she went to the registrar—and so on.\n"
"But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.\n"
"“On ne fume pas dans le salon, said Madame brutally.\n"
"Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.\n"
"“What about the theatre?—will it go on? she asked.\n"
"I don’t know, she doesn’t seem to hook on, does she?\n"
"She’d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.\n"
"“I couldn’t keep away from you, Madame, she cried.\n"
"You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.\n"
"“Yet he promised.  Again Madame smiled sardonically.\n"
"“See, my dear, that your money is safe, said Madame.\n"
"“What a good brooch, eh? Madame fingered the brooch.\n"
"There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.\n"
"“Pacohuila! cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.\n"
"A’ open ’eart ’s worth all your bum-righteousness.\n"
"“You can have that if you like, Madame, said Alvina.\n"
"The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.\n"
"But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.\n"
"“The best! He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.\n"
"And your father a month dead.  “It doesn’t matter.\n"
"He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.\n"
"Don’t you all?  The two other men smiled and nodded.\n"
"Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.\n"
