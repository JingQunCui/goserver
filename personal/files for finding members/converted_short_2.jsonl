"Alvina began to understand Madame’s subjection to him.\n"
"The bear drops Ciccio lifeless, and turns to Kishwégin.\n"
"“I should love to go.  He looked down into her eyes.\n"
"Why are you at all?  “Nonsensical? laughed Alvina.\n"
"“And what about yellow eyes? asked Alvina, laughing.\n"
"“May I hear it too?  “Oh, said Madame, drawling.\n"
"“Comment? queried Ciccio, in his slow, derisive way.\n"
"And how?—and where?—in this country?—tell me that.\n"
"Is he quite obstinate?  Geoffrey lifted his shoulders.\n"
"Madame could see the beginnings of defection in him too.\n"
"Finish this week and then go, go—But finish this week.\n"
"“Do come! she urged, never taking her eyes from him.\n"
"“Won’t you come? She smiled strangely and vividly.\n"
"Now indeed she was the dusky Eve tempted into knowledge.\n"
"True, Ciccio had no collar on, and his shoes were burst.\n"
"“I should like awfully— a flush grew on her cheek.\n"
"Alvina called Mrs. Rollings, and they composed the body.\n"
"The doctor came—she went to the registrar—and so on.\n"
"But her face was blanched and tired, without expression.\n"
"He went ducking along the dark yard, nearly to the gate.\n"
"“On ne fume pas dans le salon, said Madame brutally.\n"
"Alvina looked back at her, but did not know what to say.\n"
"“What about the theatre?—will it go on? she asked.\n"
"I don’t know, she doesn’t seem to hook on, does she?\n"
"She’d have looked down her nose at him, times gone by.\n"
"“I couldn’t keep away from you, Madame, she cried.\n"
"You said perhaps I might be with the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras.\n"
"“Yet he promised.  Again Madame smiled sardonically.\n"
"“See, my dear, that your money is safe, said Madame.\n"
"“What a good brooch, eh? Madame fingered the brooch.\n"
"Madame sat at one end of the table, Alvina at the other.\n"
"There was a spirit of great liveliness and conviviality.\n"
"“Pacohuila! cried Madame, with an imperious gesture.\n"
"When she came to her door, she turned and looked at him.\n"
"A’ open ’eart ’s worth all your bum-righteousness.\n"
"“You can have that if you like, Madame, said Alvina.\n"
"And the next day the same, she was all icy pleasantness.\n"
"The Natcha-Kee-Tawaras were a little bit put out by her.\n"
"And instinct told her that he might ignore her for ever.\n"
"But his eyes had already begun to glimmer their consent.\n"
"“The best! He made such solemn eyes, Alvina laughed.\n"
"And your father a month dead.  “It doesn’t matter.\n"
"“How not like it!  “I don’t like it, she said.\n"
"He looked curiously at Miss Pinnegar, grinning slightly.\n"
"Don’t you all?  The two other men smiled and nodded.\n"
"Geoffrey made large eyes at her as he held up his glass.\n"
"It’s almost _White Slave Traffic_, on Madame’s part.\n"
"“I love thee, I love thee as a brother, and also more.\n"
"She didn’t care a bit, really, about her own downfall.\n"
"I wish you a pleasant experience in your new occupation.\n"
"Alvina did _not_ want to go to Mansfield that afternoon.\n"
"But their hearts hardened with black, indomitable anger.\n"
"But Alvina felt herself particularly excluded, left out.\n"
"Then she wired home to her doctor for another reference.\n"
"She went rapidly from case to case, as she was summoned.\n"
"“Why I do ten times the work that any one of you does.\n"
"came the gratifying fireworks of admiration from Alvina.\n"
"But I think I’m pretty good at _feeling_ it, you know.\n"
"They went downstairs, and Alvina returned to her duties.\n"
"“The pains have begun, said Alvina, hurrying to her.\n"
"But the doctor had replied that Nurse would ring him up.\n"
"She did not like whirling in the direction of Lancaster.\n"
"“Of course!—another of Mrs. Tuke’s exclamations.\n"
"He came to her, smiling softly, to take her in his arms.\n"
"England, like a long, ash-grey coffin slowly submerging.\n"
"Ciccio talked a little with other travelling companions.\n"
"“I think it’s lovely—wonderful, she said, dazed.\n"
"Err! cried Pancrazio, striking the beast on the flank.\n"
"Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water.\n"
"Alvina came out of the icy bedroom to the black kitchen.\n"
"Then she scrubbed the two little tables and the shelves.\n"
"His yellow, luminous eyes watched her and enveloped her.\n"
"Beautiful, in our musical sense of the word, it was not.\n"

"“Is this one of your old walks? she asked, malicious.\n"

"He was quite drunk with his first sleep, and saw nothing.\n"
"Alvina accompanied him, Mr. May and the others were busy.\n"
"You’ve never been out of England?  “No, she said.\n"
"And then it was strictly a visit of ceremony or business.\n"
"I am an old woman—  “Younger than I, said Alvina.\n"
"And now let me give you one little token of my gratitude.\n"
"Alvina hurried ahead to make a light in the dark passage.\n"
"“Are they both staying, or only one? she said tartly.\n"
"“Will you come to dinner? she said to her two guests.\n"
"“What _is_ his name, Madame?  “Marasca—Francesco.\n"
"Why, her mother brought three or four thousands with her.\n"
"Pity some nice young man doesn’t turn up and marry her.\n"
"Bitterly she cried, when she bent down during the prayer.\n"
"She had watched them for her mother—and for Miss Frost.\n"
"And they all told her they thought _their_ plan was best.\n"
"“And all the business, the will and all? said Madame.\n"
"“Certainly, said Louis, bowing also over his tea-cup.\n"

"Mr. May laughed so much that he knocked his whiskey over.\n"
"Oh!  “Not if you think those things— said Alvina.\n"
"Noises went on, in the street, overhead in the work-room.\n"
"It was already ten o’clock when she hurried downstairs.\n"
"Then he’d believe in you.  But Ciccio shook his head.\n"
"“Does it mean we owe seven hundred pounds? she asked.\n"
"I can’t believe it.  “So he told me, said Alvina.\n"
"“What are we to do? said Max, pale on the cheekbones.\n"
"Curse them! Louis was muttering, in his rolling accent.\n"
"They kept within the four-square enclosure of themselves.\n"

"Lancaster was busy with a sort of fête, notwithstanding.\n"
"“I felt I ought to do something.  “Why? he asked.\n"
"Upon it was the mourning-ring Miss Frost had always worn.\n"
"“I may congratulate _you_, you mean, said the matron.\n"
"And it cast a slight slur of vulgar familiarity over her.\n"
"This she gathered from her contact with the local gentry.\n"
"Alvina comforted her and reassured her as best she could.\n"
"And to make me howl because I’ve got a child inside me.\n"
"He swallowed his in one swallow, and put aside his glass.\n"
"The faint, stupid half-smile, half-sneer was on his lips.\n"
"“She is going to have a child, said Alvina to Ciccio.\n"
"Alvina had a great difficulty in waking the inert Ciccio.\n"
"How sick she was of other people and their importunities!\n"
"Ciccio’s a treat to be with, because he’s so natural.\n"
"And so the fortnight passed, and she was under his spell.\n"
"It was his physical presence which cast a spell over her.\n"
"CHAPTER XIV THE JOURNEY ACROSS   The train began to move.\n"
"All was very still in the wintry sunshine of the Channel.\n"
"It had a grey, heaped, sordid look in the November light.\n"
"I know I shall.  “I say _no_, brother, said Ciccio.\n"
"And her heart sank as she had never known it sink before.\n"
"But underneath she was extraordinarily relieved and glad.\n"
"Ciccio wanted to have luncheon in the station restaurant.\n"
"And his English, though slow, was beautifully pronounced.\n"
"He had his cloak over his nose and his hat over his eyes.\n"
"It was rather like the crying of half-articulate animals.\n"
"Alvina sat with Ciccio stripping them, in the corn-place.\n"

"I am practical impractically— she stumbled over the words.\n"
"Yet for the first time her black eyes dilated and became warm.\n"
"But perhaps to you it is kind.  “Thank you, said Alvina.\n"
"There was not all peace in the Natcha-Kee-Tawara group either.\n"
"“Geoffrey ought to know, said Madame, looking at Geoffrey.\n"
"His face seemed colourless, neutral-tinted and expressionless.\n"
"She heard Miss Pinnegar’s scarcely audible step approaching.\n"

"“Old paste—old paste—antique—  “No, said Alvina.\n"
"Then she looked into Alvina’s eyes, really a little jealous.\n"
"“L’allée italienne! he said, and shouted with laughter.\n"
"Then, with a slight flourish, she presented the key to Ciccio.\n"
"Alvina looked brightly, as if bewildered, from one to another.\n"
"Then the men shook hands warmly with Ciccio, murmuring to him.\n"
"So she climbed weakly up the dusty, drab stairs, he following.\n"
"And he seemed to throw her down and suffocate her like a wave.\n"
"It was not a warm morning, but there was a streak of sunshine.\n"
"Perhaps the debts cover every bit of it.  “Don’t say so!\n"
"Well, all we can do after that is to wish her success in love.\n"
"“And where are the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras this week? he asked.\n"
"She turned off the gas at the meter, and went upstairs to bed.\n"
"She saw the light in his eyes fix determinedly, and he nodded.\n"
"When she could lie still she turned away from him, still mute.\n"
"“I am staying with friends, here and there, for a few weeks.\n"
"“I’m afraid there is nothing very pleasant, unfortunately.\n"
"In fact, some of them will be less badly off than they feared.\n"
"I must go this afternoon.  “On account of your engagement?\n"

"He made no definite advances till he had put a plain question.\n"
"“Oh, it will be over in six weeks, said the doctor easily.\n"

"Nothing will sing if you’re there, called the young woman.\n"
"Nurse!— came the long call of Mrs. Tuke through the night.\n"
"Then she shuddered, and dabbed her nose with her handkerchief.\n"
"Do let me see him.  “Do you really want to? said Alvina.\n"
"Ciccio shifted on his feet, watching Alvina pour out the port.\n"
"He turned immediately, with his cap in his hand, and followed.\n"
"“If you have to be torn to pieces by forces, well, you have.\n"
"However, her month’s notice was up, so she was legally free.\n"
"He pointed to the harbour clock—it was ten minutes past ten.\n"
"It was strange to feel the seethe of war and dread in the air.\n"
"She half pitied Alvina, and was more than half jealous of her.\n"
"So she drank some of the wine, and it dribbled on to her chin.\n"
"“I couldn’t get a cart to come down, he said in English.\n"
