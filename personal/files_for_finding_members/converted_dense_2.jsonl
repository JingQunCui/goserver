"He went about his work in a mechanical way, but neglected nothing.\n"
"“Do you ever contribute to these papers, Mr. Conrad? he asked.\n"
"“You have no property to dispose of by will? asked the doctor.\n"
"“Four dollars, my dear madam!  “Do you consider it too much?\n"
"He ain’t got no push, and he’s allus forgettin’ his errands.\n"
"He sat on a high stool, but he was only reading the morning paper.\n"
"“But that would be a mean thing to do, said Chester, startled.\n"
"“I will tell you, sir, said the bookkeeper, with an ugly look.\n"
"Chester must have chanced upon the receipt and carried it to Long.\n"
"“Borrow a little money from the office, answered Dick, coolly.\n"
"Before relating what followed, a word of explanation is necessary.\n"
"When he had gone, Ralston said, “Who is that, Mullins?  “Mr.\n"
"He did not care to have him speak so freely before the office boy.\n"
"He entered the office and glanced about, expecting to see Chester.\n"
"And I am to have twenty-five dollars for——  “Your trouble.\n"
"“As well as I ever expect to be, answered Mrs. Trimble, sadly.\n"
"“One year would be sufficient, it seems to me, put in Trimble.\n"
"Floyd looked up in surprise, but did not comprehend the situation.\n"
"Yes.  “Well, Chester’s bought it.  “You don’t mean it!\n"

"They were luminous and crystalline, like the eyes of a changeling.\n"
"For a little while Alvina flaunted about in her nurse’s uniform.\n"
"Alvina followed them persistently, but a little aloof, and silent.\n"
"She was completely indifferent to sight-seeing and scouring about.\n"
"She kept on wondering what she should do if he wanted to kiss her.\n"
"Witham was here till ten minutes ago.  “Yes, laughed Alvina.\n"
"“How do you explain such behaviour? said her father pettishly.\n"
"Have you got a handkerchief?  “It’s in my jacket, he said.\n"
"Every individual should, by nature, have his extraordinary points.\n"
"In the background were two booths covered up with coloured canvas.\n"
"He looked at himself sideways, and feared dismally he was thinner.\n"
"I wonder what it can be.  “I haven’t an idea, said Alvina.\n"
"And she gave a queer, sharp little rap on the table with her hand.\n"
"“I told you I had bought a cinematograph building, said James.\n"
"“She isn’t indispensable.  And Alvina was to play the piano!\n"
"But he was very happy sitting chatting tête-à-tête with Alvina.\n"
"Miss Poppy’s professional virginity was thus saved from outrage.\n"
"“My young men drink a little beer, after their horrible journey.\n"
"Well, then when shall I dance?  Alvina turned and looked at her.\n"
"They are dead.  “And you wander about the world— she said.\n"
"They had all disappeared over the brow of Lumley Hill, descending.\n"
"Why are they?  “I suppose they can’t help it, said Alvina.\n"
"“Don’t—! she cried, lifting her hand to stop his progress.\n"
"He departed on his nine mile ride through the rain to Knarborough.\n"
"It might have spoiled everything if Madame wasn’t such a genius.\n"
"From which?  “Don’t give me anything, please, said Alvina.\n"
"Then he swung round the bicycle, and stood it again on its wheels.\n"
"“If _that’s_ what you’ve seen in him!—there was a pause.\n"
"Poor thing, left alone—and hardly a penny to bless herself with.\n"
"But he felt it in his flesh, the harshness and discomfort of them.\n"
"“Ciccio didn’t come to see you, hein?  “No, said Alvina.\n"
"“Another four thousand francs there, she said, nodding sagely.\n"
"Well, ’s a strappin’ anuff feller, for them as goes that road.\n"
"If she could have imagined how far he was from any such intention.\n"
"But he confronted her like a powerful ox, full of dangerous force.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar expected Alvina, but by the train, which came later.\n"
"I’ve lived here all my life and seen everything bad happen here.\n"
"“Well I think it’s been a most agreeable game, said Mr. May.\n"
"“Not many more times here, eh? he said, smiling significantly.\n"
"He can never have left things so bad.  “Ciccio, said Alvina.\n"
"Miss Pinnegar could answer her own fate according to its question.\n"
"And she guarded her money, and watched for some other opportunity.\n"
"But soon she realized that they loved it—particularly the women.\n"
"Yet since he was club doctor and panel doctor, they had to submit.\n"
"He’s got the biggest understandin’s of any man i’ Lancaster.\n"
"Alvina glanced at her, flushed crimson and looked down to the man.\n"
"“What’s this? cried Mrs. Tuke, cocking her head on one side.\n"
"He slowly relaxed his clasp, and she slid down like rain to earth.\n"
"“I can’t, I think, she said abstractedly, looking up at him.\n"
"The depth of his warm, mindless, enveloping love was immeasurable.\n"
"The train seemed to rush ponderously, massively, across the Weald.\n"
"Nobody asked her anything—she might have been Ciccio’s shadow.\n"
"Near Chambéry they went down for breakfast to the restaurant car.\n"
"Ciccio became excited as they neared Modane, the frontier station.\n"
"And Alvina settled her cushion, and slept more or less till Genoa.\n"
"Vecchio! nodding violently and indicating that she should drink.\n"
"The group with the lantern moved again upstream, becoming smaller.\n"

"“Has Mr. Tripp spoken to you? asked Chester, his heart sinking.\n"
"When Monday morning came he rose at the usual hour and breakfasted.\n"
"“How long have you been drawing?  “Ever since I can remember.\n"
"Even his mother thought of it only as a pleasant diversion for him.\n"
"He is my uncle.  “Your uncle! exclaimed Chester, in surprise.\n"
"They thought the other might refer to a ring or some small article.\n"
"“How’s your mother this mornin’, Chester? asked the grocer.\n"
"“I don’t care to sell, Mr. Tripp, said Mrs. Rand, decisively.\n"
"“I came here by way of Pittsburg, answered the tramp, coughing.\n"
"“How did he know about my store? demanded Silas, incredulously.\n"
"“I don’t see how I can spare you, Chester, she said, soberly.\n"
"An hour glided by rapidly, and then a step was heard on the stairs.\n"
"“I shall be glad to pay you any attentions, insinuated Ralston.\n"
"New York’s a right smart place, I admit, but give me Minneapolis.\n"
"He knew now that he would be able to support himself and more, too.\n"
"Are you trying to get a place?  “No.  Felix looked surprised.\n"
"I am Mr. Mullins, his bookkeeper, and represent him.  “Just so!\n"
"He did not seem strong, and there was a sad expression on his face.\n"
"Miss Frost, hearing this legend, looked sideways at the enthusiast.\n"
"What money she made went chiefly to support the Houghton household.\n"
"There are such poles of opposition between honesties and loyalties.\n"
"The shop seemed to have digested some of its indigestible contents.\n"
"“We’re more than friends.  “I don’t think so, she said.\n"
"And then, most irritating, a complete _volte face_ in her feelings.\n"
"“Because you don’t understand what it means, said her father.\n"
"I can’t understand it.  “Can’t you? said Alvina brightly.\n"
"Purity and high-mindedness—the beautiful, but unbearable tyranny.\n"
"His strength was so different from hers—quick, muscular, lambent.\n"
"For well-to-do mothers she would charge from three to five guineas.\n"
"Her greatest horror was lest her husband should come into the room.\n"
"In these days Mrs. Houghton never talked—unless to fret a little.\n"
"So Alvina refrained from pondering on her mother’s life and fate.\n"
"And perhaps neither of them knew that the intimacy itself had gone.\n"
"“It won’t be done for nothing, he said, looking at her again.\n"
"And Miss Pinnegar and I can’t have anything to do with it anyway.\n"
"Alvina was asked back to tea—on Wednesday afternoon, closing day.\n"
"I can’t stand him.  “Why?—suddenly— said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"Between her and the Woodhouse Withams there was a decided coldness.\n"
"“There is no need to make provision for me, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"He brushed his crisp, curly brown hair carefully before the mirror.\n"
"“Of course we can _delay_ for some time, until I get my supplies.\n"
"So they watched like cats for their man’s return, at dinner-time.\n"
"“They’ve stopped again, said Miss Pinnegar, recalling Alvina.\n"
"how awful it was!  “Why?  “There was no pleasing the woman.\n"
"And when do you expect the fittings—?  “Tomorrow.  “What!\n"

"I’ll be Kishwégin. And he bridled and beamed self-consciously.\n"
"Louis arose, a _brave_ like Ciccio, in war-paint even more hideous.\n"
"Ciccio turned round and looked at them with a sneer along his nose.\n"
"You say _love_— He raised his shoulders slightly, with a shrug.\n"
"For him, it was not yet quite natural to express himself in speech.\n"
"“But if Naples is so lovely, how could you leave it? she asked.\n"
"He looked at her, and made a slight, sad gesture, indifferent also.\n"
"Ciccio was just a fantasy blown in on the wind, to blow away again.\n"
"“They are the darkest of all. And she shook her head roguishly.\n"
"“Oh, good morning, Mrs. Rollings! they heard Mr. May’s voice.\n"
"“Won’t you come? she said, smiling and looking into his eyes.\n"
"The boy was sent for the cab, James swallowed a spoonful of brandy.\n"
"Right in her bowels she felt it—the terrible, unbearable feeling.\n"
"I don’t fancy he would have wanted such people following, myself.\n"
"On the next morning she dressed herself carefully in her new dress.\n"
"In the first place, you are English, and he thinks to rise by that.\n"
"But Madame’s shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off.\n"
"And her crying started Miss Pinnegar, who cried almost as bitterly.\n"
"But not very much, I’m sure of that.  “How much do you think?\n"
"The young men thrust their glasses up towards Alvina, in a cluster.\n"
"“The leather is not good in these things of Gigi’s, she said.\n"
"“You think it’s strange? he said, showing his teeth slightly.\n"
"Salute me, my own friend.  And Ciccio kissed him on either cheek.\n"
"He threw bedclothes over her and went downstairs, whistling softly.\n"
"You are not leaving Woodhouse for ever.  “Good-bye! she said.\n"
"Your money isn’t with his, is it?  “No, said Miss Pinnegar.\n"
"The attendant women threw up their hands and looked at one another.\n"
"The doctor began by being rather lordly and condescending with her.\n"
"“It’s you I _am_ thinking about, she laughed, flirting still.\n"
"And she knew well how hateful material circumstances can make life.\n"
"She put down her name on the list of volunteers for active service.\n"
"Where is your mandoline?  He turned round and looked up the road.\n"
"Even the will of God is a life-force.  “You don’t understand!\n"
"“You come, Allaye, he said softly, with his foreign intonation.\n"
"After all, he had triumphed over his well-to-do, Anglicized cousin.\n"
"Giuseppe had insisted that Ciccio should take second-class tickets.\n"
"They were out on the platform again, they had secured their places.\n"
"The world is an amazing place.  This thought dozed her off again.\n"
"It was a wide, strange bed of dry boulders, pallid under the stars.\n"
"She was almost stupefied with weariness and the cold, bruising air.\n"
"And yet in the whole market-place she was aware of nothing but him.\n"
"Alvina hated their Cockney accent and florid showy vulgar presence.\n"
"Ciccio was still turning talking in the rapid way to his neighbour.\n"
"But there was a great, twin-towered church, wonderful from outside.\n"
