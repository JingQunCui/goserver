The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in \nSan Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a \ncouple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like \nto find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \nrequire the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \nstructure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has \nbeen mentioned is to obtain a forward commitment in order to reduce the \nequity required.

This analysis has resulted in the \nrealization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of \naccrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals \nthat have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes \ngreater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and \nvalue withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp \nwill receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes \ngreater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.

This \navailability is a multi- industry standard for simple series component \navailability.   There is no credit for maintenance or repair time time which \nis why a 3-5% loss is considered acceptable for long term performance.   The \n3-5% loss includes maintenance.   An availability metric that shows the \nturbine as available during repairs would be very objectionable to future \nowners.    Pausing the turbine during maintenance may be acceptable if the \nlong term goal is set accordingly.   For example, if the turbine is always \npaused during maintenance then the long term system goal should be close to \nthe 99.5% goal for grid availability.\n\n\n\n\nHollis Kimbrough\n05/15/2002 07:40 AM\nTo: Mark Fisher/EWC/Enron@Enro"

He took my plan and \nimproved it.  I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans.  While \nhe works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification \nlist.  Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and \nspeak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners.  I will be in San Marcos on Friday \nApril 13th.  Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through \nthat day?  Also can you provide some references?\n\nOnce I have the plans and specs, I will send them to you so you can adjust \nyour bid.  \n\nPhillip\n"

In addition, he has begun to \ncoordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the \nsmaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going \nto fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to \ncomplete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which \n$14,000 are due now for work completed.  \n\nWe are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by \nthe original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.

With the labor true-up process in place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end the standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual.  During the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.  From an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting feature of SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being utilized to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will always exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will limit the varian"

Traders put the two together, anticipated a \nsupply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \n\nTraders do that all the time; they're looking forward, said William Burson, \na trader. It makes the market for natural gas. \n\nBut the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \nAssociation's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \nstorage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \nnumbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \nreality. \n\nIt's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what \nwe are reporting, McGill said. \n\nAs consumer outrage builds over high heat"

The parking lot has a sign that says Wayland Properties (or \nsomething very close to that).

The\nleague's commissioner can schedule consolation matchups\nduring the playoff tournament. In the Front Office, go to\nSchedule, Matchups and choose the week(s) that your\nplayoffs take place. Under Other Games, you can set any\nmatchups you want. If there are two teams that split the\nregular season series, here's a great way to settle the\nscore.

Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate\n\n2.  Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million\n\n3.  The investors' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.\n\n4.  All parties are GP's but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?\n\n5.  60/40 split favoring the investors.\n\nWith regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a \nsolid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes \ncosts.  Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses.  Keith and I \nwould like to oversee the bookkeeping.  The builders would be requred to fax \nall invoices within 48 hours.

He mentioned that the Price Anderson Act has brought about \nopposition in the past, but has typically breezed through the renewal \nprocess. The NIRS website seemed to more anti-nuclear power focused, so it \nwas interesting that he did not see the Act as having any trouble in its \nrenewal.\n\nMy perspective is that nuclear power accounted for about 20% of all power \ngeneration last year, and would cause rolling black-outs if ceased. Politics \nand recent surveys of the positive turn in public opinion suggests that it \nwould be highly unlikely for nuclear power to be phased out. Nuclear plants \nnearing the end of their initial useful life period - around 30 years - have \nalready begun an extension process. Five reactors have been licensed for \nanother 20 y"

Since the Plant index number records the sequence by \nturbine, we can use this to detect when gaps in the data occur.  In \nparticular, in the Errdev we expect a consecutive Plant index number for each \nturbine ID and status message.  \n\nIf we push the data to the SQL server and create an auto number, the status \nmessages for each turbine will have a sequential auto number, but NOT be \nconsecutive.  Using the Plant Index number has become a very useful field in \nanalysis of the Errdev data.\n\nWe need to store the Plant Index as it is written.\n\nComments?\n\nJeff Duff\n"

I have \nmodeled the impact of frequency.  This model demonstrates that the frequency \nis significant in the final answer.   Take a look at the column totals for \neach measurement frequency.\n\nIn my e-mail I referenced the SCADA system and did not include the sub \nstation as it was not my intention to include a reference to the substation.  \nI agree that we can integrate the values at the substation to get a total net \npower but this ignores the constraint the utility is introducing, chiefly \nthat they want to be paid for consumed power at a different rate than the \nrate they pay for power.\n\nIn the model you will find 30 time intervals for measurement.  They can be \nwhatever intervals you want.  Then there are measurement frequencies which \nare defined in terms of the intervals.  Since the utility requires that we \npay for consumed power "

I have a question about a sequence of \nevents. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is Energy curtailed \n(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message Turbine Com Established (Index = \n10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a Energy \ncurtailed message (Index = 11134).\n\nIs there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment \nmessages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established \nmessage was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no \nmessage was recorded? \n\nThanks,\nMark\n"

My \nunderstanding and review of these files suggests they store a reference power \ncurve, and an accumulated wind speed distribution and power.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Do you know if this reference curve is turbine, site, or generic \nspecific?  If turbine or site, is it an engineering or warranted curve?  Who \nmanages the input of the curve data?\n\n2. I assume the wind distribution is derived from the nacelle anemometer.  Do \nyou know if the data has all the same transformations applied as they do in \nthe Minana file?\n\n3.  How is the power value derived for the corresponding wind speed in the \ndistribution?  Also, how is the reference power for this distribution derived?\n\nI am trying to determine if we need to develop a reference power curve table \nfor the Crystal Report application.\n\n-JD\n"

Keeping up with the volume of e-mail is burdensome,\nindeed often stressful. The unnecessary retention of e-mail uses valuable IT\nresources, and the volume of unnecessary e-mail slows down our ability to\nprocess and find the materials we really need. Importantly, recent court\ncases illustrate how e-mails, which are so useful because of their\ninformality and speed, can become the subject of intense scrutiny over\nmeanings the authors may never have intended. Words and phrases intended to\nbe ironic, sarcastic or amusing can be taken out of context with\nembarrassing - and unintentionally harmful - consequences.\n  (1) Proper document retention is one important way to\ncontrol these burdens and risks.

The book\ncovers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.\n\nI find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -\ninteresting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years\nlearning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,\nstructures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have\nlasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman build"

His status for Sunday's game\nagainst the Bears remains in doubt. It appears that Martin was drilled in\nthe tailbone by a Dolphins defender. It swelled up on the team flight back\nfrom Miami, and ice was applied. Al Groh has declined to provide specifics,\nexcept to say the injury occurred in the general pelvic region.\nThe Jets' star running back, who underwent intensive treatment yesterday,\nhas told several people that he's fine. He's known for his high pain\nthreshold, and it wouldn't shock teammates if he played this week.\n\nMy View:  Players are notorious for being optimistic but Martin is a tough\nguy.  Another reason "

We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. \n\nThis situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made.

One of the special iBuyit components is an automated accounts \npayable feature that will improve the way you code and approve invoices. \n\nAs of May 1, you will be able to access iBuyit Payables and\n? choose budget codes from simple drop down menus\n? receive e-mail when you have an invoice that needs to be coded and/or \napproved; and\n? view an electronic image of the actual invoice\n\nThese improvements will help you assign codes more accurately and will reduce \nthe time you spend processing invoices for payment.  The AP tool will also \nbegin to eliminate the need for coding sheets or other paper information \ncurrently in use.  \n\nThis tool will provide us the opportunity to transition our Houston-based AP \nprocessing functions to a third party, SourceNet Solutions.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \nrepairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \ncost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \nrepairs.\n\n2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \nmanager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \ninterest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \nthat could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \nmanagement company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \nonsite.\n\n3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \nwant to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\n\n4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \nthis deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\n\nMy job just doesn't give me"

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be \nrecouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would \nbe paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.\n\n\n\nSince almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the \ninvestment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned \nearlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as \npart of the construction contract.  \n\nJust to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look \nlike here are a few ideas:\n\n 1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from \nhigher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.\n\n 2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase \n1 complete in November)\n      +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule\n      -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule\n\nThis way if thing"

Coach Jim Haslett was pumping up the\nteam with the it's just one player talk following the loss of Ricky\nWilliams and indicated New Orleans would likely not go outside for RB help.\nFormer Ram Jerald Moore and rookie Chad Morton were slated to carry the\nload.  But they did go out and sign Terry Allen Tuesday.  I'm not sure\nwhether this indicates a lack of confidence in Moore / Morton.  It could be\nthey thought Allen was a bargain and it certainly can't hurt to have him for\ninsurance.\n\nAs far as the RB distribution goes, I'm kind of leaning toward Moore seeing\na good bit of work with Morton seeing more 3rd down type duties.  Sort of\nlike the Patriots are doing with JR Redmond and Kevin Faulk.  Honestly, it's\ntough to call right now and the Saints understandably are being tight lipped\nabout their plans.\n\nHere's the story from USA Today.  Thanks to our friend Leo Scanlon for\n"

Inbox\nX-Origin: Allen-P\nX-FileName: PALLEN (Non-Privileged).pst\n\nPhillip, the insurance/repairs numbers are actually overstated; they are based on calculations from USPSL owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\n\nI have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\n\nIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here.

My only comment is that George and Larry might \nobject to the language that the bank that was requested to finance the \nconstruction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs \nof the construction of the Project.   Technically, that bank lowered the \nloan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of \nequity that would be required. \n\nDid I loan them $1,300,000?  I thought it was less.\n\nRegarding Exhibit A, the assets include:  the land, architectural plans, \nengineering completed, appraisal, and soils study.   Most of these items are \nin a state of partial completion by the consultants.  I have been speaking \ndirectly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer.   I am unclear on \nwhat is the best way to proceed with these consultants.  \n\nThe obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.

A press conference is scheduled for\nthis afternoon with Dave Campo. Just an FYI.\n\nThanks Michael and also thanks to our buddy Daniel Dunsworth for the info.\nI doubt you had Warren starting on your playoff bound FF team but this says\na lot about their faith in Emmitt Smith.  Michael Wiley likely backs up\nSmith now but for them to cut Warren loose with Smith just a few games\nremoved from a concussion is a pretty strong statement.  Smith proved once\nagain last week he's a gamer I'd think removing the threat of Warren\nstealing a few carries has to slightly increase his value.\n\nHave a nice evening.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\ncheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com\n\n"

The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \ninjected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\n                    This creates a shortage in later months.\n\n 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \ndemand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \n                      Specific questions should include:  \n\n  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \nto fill storage?\n\n  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \nmuch gas from Socal's system.  \n       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting"

Many owners & I.E.'s think that System Okay means the \nturbine should produce power, as per the power curve,  during every second of \nSOT.  This isn't true.    If the turbine is paused offline or manually \nstopped, untwisting cables, resetting, undergoing a load shutdown,  in low \nnoise operation, or  in spinning or starting up mode, then the SOT clock is \nincremented even though the turbine can't produce power.  I think the SOT \ndescription should read something likenot faulted off for turbine \nmalfunction or offline for failed turbine systems.  Either that or call th"

I read Valerie's note about how they're not geared toward providing that because of their FERC COA vs. SAP.  The allocations page possibly, but they will likely need to provide their best estimate of all of the O&M detail.  However, given that their sale is pending, I don't know what level of scrutiny will be afforded to PGE's costs.  I will check with Lindsey, Butts, et.al. to see.\n\nAlso, their file is linked to all of their source files.  This is unacceptable - this exposes our model to linking complications (their file opens up with a manual calculation required to update the numbers) and causes rounding errors.

Review and audit complex deals- Under the assume it is messed up \npolicy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need \nfurther      scrutiny.\n\n3.  Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical \nimbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?\n\n4.  Lead trading track program-  Recruit, oversee rotations, design training \ncourses, review progress and make cuts.\n\n5.  Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts.
