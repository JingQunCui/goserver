I usually try t wait for sales there, but the \u201cIntrovert\u201d shirt just spoke to my soul, and I\u2019m really feeling the space/lunar vibe these days (plus purple\u2014how could I resist?). I also really appreciate that the text \u201cLove you to the moon and back\u201d are really small (it's not my favorite saying)\u2026 although that is caused several people to go \u201cWait! what does the shirt say?\u201d and make more of an effort to read it! Kind of opposite of the effect I\u2019m going for haha!\\n\\nIt\u2019s a shame that the taito leggings from Target are sold out because these are super soft! I legit tried them on last September and had self-control for 11 month! \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nThe sandals were an unexpected purchase back when Karuna and I raided you\u2019s shoe section! They\u2019re\u2026 okay. I wanted a flat black sandal, so they definitely fulfill that need, but they\u2019re not the more comfortable, and they\u2019re a little big\u2014I probably should have gone a half size down. (My feet are super narrow, and I\u2019m\"]"]}
