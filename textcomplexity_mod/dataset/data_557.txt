It is your job to rebuild the bridges and get traffic moving again. Initially, the bridges built are made of simple wood, but over the course of the game, some bridges allow for use of concrete pillars, high-tension cables, and steel girders. Unfortunately, this small, impoverished country seems to have very little funds to restore its recently-destroyed infrastructure; there is a budget that must be adhered to.\n\nYou cannot build beyond the budget that is imposed, so you have to think incredibly carefully about how to build the bridges. Each one built must be able to support two vehicles crossing at one time without collapsing, and this is how levels are completed.
