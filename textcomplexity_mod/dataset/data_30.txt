The platform gives you the added height without the discomfort of a super tall heel, plus the studding all over the heel and front of the shoe add a lot of flavor ;)\"\n\n\"These shoes have neutral snake skin colors that can be worn throughout the year. The heel is not too high with the platform attached to the shoe. The hematite beading decoration on the front of the shoes is extra pretty and matches my jewerly and another thing I like about these shoes is the fact that I don't feel like I just entered an elevator going straight up when I put them on. In addition, there are small beads from the top of the heels to the bottom of heels. I like these shoes very much.\"\n\n\"This shoe was the Star of my order...when I pulled them out of the box, I was very pleased. Very cute, nicely studded heel with a lil understated bling on the top...perfect as the star of the show or to blend in with that perfect outfit. These shoes have some serious swagger.
