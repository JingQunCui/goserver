My destination was actually in Spokane Valley, WA. The locals would probably crucify me, but tend to think of them as the same area.\n\nSmall Main St type of town\n\nA large lake along Route 2\n\nOn the way here, from Leavenworth, WA, drove Route 2 east-bound and it was a very nice trip through farm country, and some quaint little towns where Route 2 was the typical main street as seen in photographs, lots of charming shops and restaurants. Didn't stop at any of them.\n\nOne thing I learned from this experience is that traveling in an RV is definitely not as fast as other forms of transport, such as a car. It blew past my estimate traveling here.\n\nStayed at Eagles Aerie #2 for one night, traveling through Spokane during rush hour as everyone is on their way home, not a good thing in noisy diesel rig. Then headed over to Spokane Valley Eagles as that is right around the block from my destination", "member_neighbors": ["[\"It\u2019s remarkable how a well-staged Broadway production can transcend the defects of a play.
