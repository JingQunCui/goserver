Most button mashers are inexperienced newbies who don\u2019t know how a fighting engine, or the timing, for some fighting game works. This technique is usually quite easy to beat as long as you have the jist of how to play that particular game. However, there are some games that button mashing will actually help intermediate and semi-advanced players, such as trying to find super KO combos in Marvel vs. Capcom. Sometimes, two or more buttons must be pressed at one time, so button mashing can produce fruitful results.\n\nIn addition to the multiple joystick rotation, button mashing will wear down controllers and arcade machines faster than if they were used in their normal fashion. So please be kind to the equipment that brings us joy and laughter, and keep the button mashing to a minimum. Know your game and victory will be ripe for the picking.", "member_neighbors": ["['Your Mac mini comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a one-year limited warranty.
