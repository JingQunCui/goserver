All the teachers never seemed to care, but thats because alot of teachers are retarded. My ADHD seemed to reach its peek in 3rd grade and I was put on medicine (for the second time) For about 3 years. I felt like I had vomit I couldn't eat, it practically ruined my social life. I decided I wasn't going to let this happen anymore. So I did everything I could to stay focused, and I worked as hard as possible (it was hard as f***). After 5th grade my parents said I could get of the meds, And im currently in 7th grade, Iu'm in 8th grade math and english and have A honor roll, no meds. So thats just my story. You can do the same. It won't be easy and it takes time, but you can do it! I would be more then happy to aid/offer you advice on your endeavor.\n\nI have ADHD and take meds, they make me not hungry AT ALL.
