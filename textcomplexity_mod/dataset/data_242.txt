In 1741 he and another government supporter, whom he had put up for the second Milborne Port seat, were returned after a contest; but when faced with a petition, which in the state of the House might have led to the loss of both seats, he agreed to vacate his own seat by temporarily taking an office of profit, leaving one of his opponents to be returned unopposed.3 He was re-elected for the next Parliament, towards the end of which he was drawing a secret service pension of \u00a3600 a year. The rest of his political career is that of a parliamentary beggar, perpetually in financial difficulties, partly due to the cost of maintaining his interest at Milborne Port.4 On his death, 21 July 1763, his estate passed to his nephew, Thomas Hutchings, who assumed the name and arms of Medlycott and succeeded him as Member for the borough.", "member_neighbors": ["['Tag Archives: condemnation\\n\\nAmerican Christianity has introduced seriously incorrect concepts into Christianity.
