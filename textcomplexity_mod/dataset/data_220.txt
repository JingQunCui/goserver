It has been suggested that the difference is due to a period decrease caused by the comet's activity during its last close approach to the Sun in 2009. However, rather than the expected decrease in the spin period, recent navigation data from the Rosetta spacecraft has shown that the period has increased by 80.5 s as of Apr 13, 2015, as the comet approaches perihelion. Keller et al. estimate the water sublimation rate on each facet of a 3D model of the comet to calculate the global torque acting on the comet and infer changes in rotation rate. They show that the model qualitatively explains the modest increase in period observed in the first half of 2015 and predict that the rotation period should then decrease rapidly by about 13", "nonmember": "Looking for answers to old problems\n\nOn any other day, the Jan. 23 confirmation that another BSE-carrying cow had been discovered in Canada would have rocked that nation and its Canadian beef-importing neighbor to the south. But Jan. 23 wasn\u2019t any other day; it was Election Day in Canada and by nightfall the mad cow had taken backseat to the emerging news that the Conservative Party \u2013 a party that didn\u2019t even exist until 2003 \u2013 had captured Parliament after nearly 13 years of Liberal reign. The upset. The mild upset, which anointed 46-year-old Conservative leader Stephen Harper Prime Minister, became an even bigger story the next day when vote totals showed Conservative candidates sweeping nearly every riding, or district, in Canada\u2019s farming and ranching provinces. Indeed, from Ontario in the east to British Columbia in the west, the rural breadbasket of Canada delivered 105 of the 124 seats Conservatives claimed in the House of Commons. Liberals pocketed just 68 in the same provinces. Voting for change. Clearly, farmers and ranchers voted for change and, just as clearly, they need it. Battered by BSE, bad weather and sagging commodity prices, Canadian farmers have been bleeding red ink for years.
