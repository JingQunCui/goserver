Led by Lieutenant Colonel Tejero, they took the parliamentarians hostage under gunpoint. Their aim was to remove the current prime minister, Adolfo Su\u00e1rez, and largely reverse the transition to democracy that Su\u00e1rez had overseen since Franco\u2019s death. By default, Spanish television recorded this attempted, but ultimately failed, coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, making it possibly the only coup ever captured on TV.

But Cercas points out that not all parliamentarians shied away. The three notable exceptions were the current prime minister, Su\u00e1rez, his deputy and chief of staff of the Spanish army, Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Mellado, and the party leader of the recently legalized Communist party, Santiago Carrillo.
