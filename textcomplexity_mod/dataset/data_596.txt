Unlike conventional electronics that challenge manufacturers in terms of reducing the size of devices, atom-sized electronics enable miniaturization of electronics. The technology not only aids in reducing the size of the electronics but also improves functionality by increasing performance, processing speed, and memory storage. It can be noted that nanomaterials play a key role in the development of atomic electronics. Also, with the evolution of smartphones, wearables, flexible electronics, and Internet-of-Things (IoT), members of the consumer electronics value chain can adapt atomic electronics, thereby developing advanced electronic products.\n\nThe technology and innovation report highlights key technologies enabling development of atomic electronic devices. The report offers insights on the technology, stakeholders, and key industry initiatives. It also assesses technology cycle and the global development and adoption footprint. Nano-based technologies such as quantum computing, atom-sized transistors and nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nanowires are evaluated in the report.", "member_neighbors": ["[\"Jamie Lee Rathburn of Riddle dies in crash in Canyonville\\n\\nRelated Media\\n\\nCANYONVILLE \u2014 A single mother of three young boys died in a car accident Friday night on Canyonville-Riddle Road.\\n\\nJamie Lee Rathburn, 26, of Riddle was driving a 1994 Ford Explorer east near Milepost 1 at about 10:20 p.m. , his vehicle weaved out of its lane , rolled multiple times, according to the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\\n\\nDeputies said Rathburn was thrown from the vehicle , pronounced dead at the scene.\\n\\nSheriff\u2019s , Dwes Hutson said it appeared Rathburn was not wearing a seat belt.\\n\\nA friend of Rathburn\u2019s, Dawn Dunlap, 29) said today that Rathburn was another single mother of three young boys.\\n\\nShe said she and Rathburn worked together at Ken's Sidewalk Cafe near Canyonville for the past six months.\\n\\n\u201cEverybody there is like a close-knit family so this has been very hard for us,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cJamie had an awesome sense of humor.
