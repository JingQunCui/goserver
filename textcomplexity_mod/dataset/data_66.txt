Now with age, I've decided to look back and do it right.\n\nGood software needs a good foundation. I am looking not at building any specific application (yet), but rather a framework for properly articulating PFSRD/PRD creatures.\n\nIn my pacing/brainstorming/wasting-time-should-be-doing-something-else-ing I have come to the conclusion that, in fact, two frameworks need to be created: PRDML for representing rules, and PRDStore for representing creatures created with those rules.\n\nPRDML will need to be quite extensive. A \"PRDCORE\" listing will need to hold all the base rules (encumbrance tables, effects of character levels, etc.). Extra rule sets can hold specific classes. Such that each book (core, or otherwise) can be articulated in a manner that is universally understood.\n\nPRDStore will be a much less comprehensive project. This should only hold arbitrary data that is not derived. So it would hold levels and feat choices, but not hold BAB (because bab is a derived stat from the rules).\n\nThis is not for a specific application goal, but rather a means of expanding PRD coverage to make open software design more feasible.\n\nI'm looking at starting", "member_neighbors": ["['watching the line and puttingt\\n\\nI know its not ok to stand behind when someone was putting such as to watch his line.\\n\\nBut, was it ok..to quickly run behind someone who just putted to do this same?\\n\\nFm gamemanship, is it ok?
