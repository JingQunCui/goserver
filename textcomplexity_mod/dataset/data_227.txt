Tacos may be the simplest option for feeding a lot of people, and today we are bringing you one of our favorite taco stuffings: barbacoa beef, tender and full of rich, complex flavors. Yes, did you know you can make that tasty stuff you buy at Chipotle in your own kitchen \u2014 and in your slow cooker, no less?\n\nI have a serious thing for barbacoa. It's a love affair to be written about as in the steamiest of romance novels. (You know, if those were about food, instead of people.) Barbacoa is full of flavor and so simple to make. It's a set-it-and-forget-it meal that can be made with little preparation in your slow cooker.\n\nBarbacoa is a simple dish that can be made into all sorts of meals. You might make tacos, burritos, extreme nachos, or even hash for breakfast in the morning. Once it's prepared, the uses are endless, and knowing you have some on hand always makes for good eats.\n\nSo even if you're not having 30 football-crazed fans over to your house to watch the big game, make the full amount anyway.", "member_neighbors": ["[\"This spell, like many others, will easily integrate with each other to present society with more complexity and danger.\\n\\nAnd extensibility.
