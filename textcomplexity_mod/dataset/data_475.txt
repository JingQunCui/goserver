Having said that, let me take a step back and let me tell you about me. I am from India and I\u2019m an engineer. My undergraduate degree was Electronic Engineering. I came to Georgia Tech and did my masters in Industrial Engineering. I ended up starting my first company completely by mistake because I was in the computational group at Georgia Tech. This is way before Big Data became sexy.\n\nMathematics is my background. I love Math. Big Data has become a very sexy thing now. It never used to be like that. I was a grad student when Delta came to Georgia Tech and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got this really big problem. We want to optimize how we assign our aircraft to route.\u201d Long story short, I ended up becoming the liaison from Georgia Tech. I had a phenomenal team on our site at Delta working on the project.
