Here below we've made multi-level submenu for instance.\n\n2. Container\n\nUnlike Anchor, when you add a Container, it means you add a no-title box to your menu. Just a blank space, no title editing. You can only edit style (width, background color, style, position\u2026) in Submenu tab and Class Attribute (for those who have coding knowledge) in the General tab.\n\n3.
